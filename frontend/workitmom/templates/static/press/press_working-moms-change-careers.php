					<h2>Working moms change careers and start their own businesses to gain more flexibility and work-life balance</h2>
					<p> Women are starting businesses at twice the rate of men in the US and more than 10 million small businesses are run and owned by women. According WorkItMom.com, an online community for working mothers, many of these women are moms who change careers and start a business as a way to gain more flexibility and work-life balance.</p>
					<p>Boston, MA (PRWEB) February 25, 2008 &ndash; Working moms change careers and start their own businesses as a way to gain more flexibility and work-life balance. Members of www.workitmom.com, an online community dedicated specifically to working mothers, recently shared their inspiration and reasons for becoming entrepreneurs. While many have always wanted to start their own business, having kids and wanting a job that is flexible and allows them to continue to work and to spend time with their kids motivated them to take the plunge.</p>
					<p>Yvette Segal quit her career as a fashion executive to launch a new business after becoming a mom.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;The business I was in before I had kids was not very family friendly. When I had my son I was spending long hours at the office and felt like I was missing so much. As soon as he was born, I knew I wanted to find a way to work and be able to see him more.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Yvette came up with an idea to create an online community centered around kids&rsquo; wish lists and is currently working on launching www.mykidsregistry.com from her home. &ldquo;It is really hard being home with kids and at the same time you are trying to launch a business with no help. Next year my daughter will be in preschool so I'll have more time to dedicate to it. Still, I am thrilled I am doing it.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Gaining more flexibility while continuing to work and doing something she was passionate about inspired Nataly Kogan to create WorkItMom.com in the first place. She had a successful career as a venture capitalist in New York but saw her daughter for just a half hour on some days.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d always wanted to launch my own business and doing something that gave me more flexibility to spend more time with my daughter was the final push that I needed. I work harder than I ever have, but I get to choose the 80 hours a week when I work. Being able to see my daughter more, get to know her teachers, be part of her life&ndash; it&rsquo;s priceless and I&rsquo;m willing to work until 3am to make it happen.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Moms who run their own business are under no illusion that it&rsquo;s an easy way to make a living. They often work harder and put in more hours than they did in their regular jobs. But they say that it&rsquo;s the flexibility of working around their kids&rsquo; schedules that they find so appealing.</p>
					<p>After becoming a mom, SK Joun quit her successful 15-year career with a Fortune 500 financial services company to launch a new magazine for parents called Parents for Parents (www.parentsforparentsmag.com)</p>
					<p>&ldquo;I have always had the entrepreneur spirit inside of me,&rdquo; says SK. &ldquo;Being self-employed, I don't necessarily have more time; I have more flexibility of time. For example, I spend every Wednesday afternoons with my older son &ndash; I could not do that if I was not self-employed.&rdquo;</p>
