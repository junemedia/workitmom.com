		<description>Mir, I just have to say that, as painful as your experience was, I'm grateful that your other blog was down for awhile. Had it not been, I would not have hunted you down in stalker fashion and found this blog! I enjoy Nataly and her fresh view of working, organization, life! This is a great place to be.</description>

		<description>A capella music is the best. If you enjoy this style, look for The Blenders. Yes, the Blenders. They are fabulous. I cannot stay in a bad mood while listening the The Blenders sing all my Christmas faves in their unique and silky-voiced way!</description>
