			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>School is well underway, and that usually means packing lunchboxes.</p>
<p>I confess: the contents of my kids&#8217; lunchboxes aren&#8217;t all that exciting.</p>
<p>We have 3 kids, the oldest two are in high school and the youngest is in grade school. During the week, they all do some combination of buying and taking their lunches. The youngest is allowed to buy lunch at school 2 days a week and he decides which days those will be at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>The older kids either buy or take lunch, it&#8217;s up to them. They can buy lunch as long as they have the money (we put a certain amount on their accounts each month), otherwise, they pack their own lunches.</p>
<p>The hardest part for me about packing lunches is making sure there&#8217;s a variety of things ready to go, and to be honest, I&#8217;m not particularly imaginative at it. Blogs and women&#8217;s magazines are full of cute and creative ideas for packing lunches for school, and I think they&#8217;re great ideas, but in reality, our school lunch routine usually leans toward more standard fare.</p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s more than &#8220;standard fare&#8221;, I freely admit, our lunches are pretty boring. As much as I&#8217;d love to be that person, I probably won&#8217;t make cute food in little plastic boxes or arrange colorful food in interesting shapes to take to school. Speed is of the essence around here even though we pack lunches the night before.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wonder how our seemingly mundane routines like school lunches compare to other people&#8217;s.  I&#8217;ve feared we were known as the &#8220;boring lunch family&#8221; at school, but I put my fears at ease yesterday when it was my turn to be the cafeteria volunteer. As far as I could tell, most lunches looked about like the ones I send, but there was the occasional creative one.</p>
<p>Packed lunches around here usually consists of sandwiches with peanut butter and jelly or meat and cheese, some fruit, occasionally chips and sometimes, dessert. I occasionally try to mix it up a little, but you never know what anyone&#8217;s going to eat, and we sometimes end up with things in the pantry that never actually leave.</p>
<p>I routinely stock bread, peanut butter and jelly, turkey, ham, cheese as well as fruit packages of pears, mandarin oranges and applesauce, and we build on that with other things. I try to accommodate if someone has a special request, but they never really do.</p>
<p>Sometimes, my daughter will get her own items at the grocery store and my middle child will make &#8220;interesting&#8221; concoctions to take (peanut butter and a whole banana on a hot dog bun, anyone?), but I always keep the basics on hand, and they tell me that&#8217;s OK.</p>
<p>However, it doesn&#8217;t matter if my lunches are boring or interesting if the food I bought isn&#8217;t there when I go to pack it.</p>
<p>None of my kids can resist the siren song of the individually wrapped package (especially the teenage boy), and I&#8217;ve talked until I&#8217;m blue in the face about, &#8220;If it&#8217;s in a little package and it&#8217;s for one person, I don&#8217;t want you to eat it at home&#8221;, so I&#8217;ve had to resort to some fairly drastic measures to make sure the lunchbox stock doesn&#8217;t get eaten in front of the TV, ten packages at a time.</p>
<p>I have to keep a small reminder on the lunchbox items for certain teenage boys:</p>
<p><a title="Pantry by Busy Mom, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/busymom/6142946104/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6160/6142946104_5240588a99_m.jpg" alt="Pantry" width="179" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, that does draw a little attention when guests are looking in our pantry and I have to explain myself, but it&#8217;s worth the savings.</p>
<p>What about you? Are your kids&#8217; lunchboxes packed with fancy things (I&#8217;m always open to suggestions for new, time-efficient lunchbox ideas!) , or do you stick to the tried and true like we do?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This recipe got fourteen ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs up. I don&#8217;t know that you can get a rating much better than that.</p>
<p>It is also very, very easy.<span id="more-193"></span></p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0416 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/3391565661/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3433/3391565661_51133a3983.jpg" alt="DSC_0416" width="392" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>2lbs ground beef<br />
2 24 oz jars of picante sauce (I used mild)<br />
1 or 2 cans green chilies<br />
shredded Mexican blend cheese<br />
tortillas (corn or flour)<br />
sour cream (optional)</p>
<p>Step One:<br />
<a title="DSC_0413 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/3391565655/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3462/3391565655_6c053dc0e8.jpg" alt="DSC_0413" width="392" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Brown the ground beef.</p>
<p>Step Two:</p>
<p>Add one jar of picante sauce and canned chilies. Allow to simmer for about five minutes.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0417 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/3391565663/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3593/3391565663_3f2ce7b223.jpg" alt="DSC_0417" width="392" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Step Three:</p>
<p>In your pyrex baking dish, pour a little of the picante sauce on the bottom of the dish. This helps to prevent the tortillas from sticking.</p>
<p>Then make a layer of tortillas.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0419 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/3391565673/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3664/3391565673_2f0ee0e0e2.jpg" alt="DSC_0419" width="392" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I ended up putting a quarter of a tortilla in the little empty spot on the bottom right hand corner.</p>
<p>Step Four:</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0420 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/3391565683/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3391565683_7a156d9a30.jpg" alt="DSC_0420" width="392" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Make a layer of the ground beef mixture. Then layer the shredded cheese.</p>
<p>Think of it like making a lasagna. A Mexican lasagna.</p>
<p>Step Five:</p>
<p>Another layer of tortillas. Then ground beef mixture. Then shredded cheese.</p>
<p>Step Six:</p>
<p>Another layer of tortillas. Then ground beef mixture. Then shredded cheese.</p>
<p>Step Seven:</p>
<p>Another layer of tortillas. Only THIS time you are going to pour the rest of the picante sauce over the top.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0424 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/3391565691/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3643/3391565691_bdd1d7f56c.jpg" alt="DSC_0424" width="392" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Step Eight:</p>
<p>Cover with tinfoil and place into the oven. Bake covered for 25-30 minutes at 400 degrees.</p>
<p>Step Nine:</p>
<p>Remove from oven. Uncover and top with more shredded cheese.</p>
<p>Place it back in the oven for a few minutes, until the cheese melts.</p>
<p>Step Ten:</p>
<p>Once out of the oven, allow it to cool for a few minutes before cutting. This will help it stay together better.</p>
<p>Step Eleven:</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0427 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/3391624283/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3547/3391624283_b6eed3a481.jpg" alt="DSC_0427" width="392" height="225" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.workitmom.com/blog/">Nataly</a> emailed me last week asking if I had any no cook recipes in my repertoire and could I pretty please share them.  </p>
<p>My first thought was, &#8220;Well, I can pour a mean bowl of cereal!&#8221;  Because who among us doesn&#8217;t try to convince our children that it was THEIR idea to have a bowl of cereal for dinner every now and then.</p>
<p>But I got thinking about summer schedules and the heat and how most of us want to be out enjoying the weather, not tied to our hot stoves once we get home from work.  So I thought I would  offer up some tips to making summer cooking easier.  <span id="more-161"></span></p>
<p>1) Cook once, serve many times. </p>
<p>For example, when I am grilling up some chicken breast, I will do way more than I actually need for the meal.   Then I slice up the chicken into strips and divide it into ziploc bags.  Toss the bags into the freezer.  The reason I slice  up the chicken, because I know someone will ask, it defrosts much more quickly that way.</p>
<p>Now the cooking you did for chicken fajitas, will turn into a leafy green salad with grilled chicken breast, a chicken salad sandwich, chicken added to a pasta with pesto sauce, or any other number of things that you can do with cooked chicken breast.   But now you don&#8217;t have to expend the effort to  cook the chicken each time.    </p>
<p>This has got to be my favorite tip.  I do this all the time as evidenced by my <s>ungrateful brats</s> adoring family groaning, &#8220;Are we having grilled chicken <em>again</em> tonight?&#8221; To which I reply, &#8220;Keep it up and there is a bowl of Cheerios with your name written all  over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>See what I just did there?  Uh-huh, a win-win situation for all of us.  Which brings me to&#8230;</p>
<p>2) If it is good enough for another meal of the day, it is good enough for dinner.</p>
<p>Alternate title: who decided that sandwiches were just for lunch?  If you are cooking up some bacon on the weekend, the only time I ever make bacon, make some extra and save it in the fridge.  Later in the week introduce  your family to the joy of the BLT sandwich.  Or crumble the bacon and sprinkle on top of a salad.  </p>
<p>Hard boil some eggs and make egg salad sandwiches.  Heck, nothing is wrong with PB&amp;J either.  Add some decorative vegetables to the table if it makes you feel better.  </p>
<p>Or even better, let go of the guilt.</p>
<p>3) Think outside the box.</p>
<p>Alternate title: Hor d&#8217; oeuvres, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s for dinner.   Hummus and veggies,  Whole grain crackers and cheese.  Cut up fruit.  The itty-bitty bread, which I am sure has its own special name, made into itty-bitty sandwiches is ALWAYS a huge hit.  </p>
<p>Another secret, let them eat all the food with some of those cellophane wrapped toothpicks.  </p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, this meal is not hearty enough for my older boys who are intent on eating everything that isn&#8217;t nailed down, but it serves as a nice appetizer for them while they forage for leftovers in the fridge. I like to think of that is giving them valuable life skills. Their wives will thank me one day. </p>
<p>4) Use your other appliances that don&#8217;t require you to stand over them while they do their magic.</p>
<p>Break out that crockpot, rice maker, toaster oven, or microwave.   How about a baked potato bar? Bake the potatoes in your microwave.  (I don&#8217;t own a microwave so I bake  my potatoes by wrapping them in tin foil and throwing them into our firepit.  We sit around the fire and relax while the potatoes cook.)  </p>
<p>Set out various toppings like: sour cream, grated cheese, cooked broccoli, black beans, whatever floats your boat.</p>
<p>If you want to be extra fancy schmancy use sweet potatoes.  As a bonus they are also healthier for you.  Plus, I am not sure why, it just sounds better when you tell people. </p>
<p>&#8220;So, what are you making for dinner tonight?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;We are having a baked potato bar.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ohhhhhh&#8230;.&#8221; thinking, <em>she is only serving her family a side dish?</em></p>
<p>Opposed to this:</p>
<p>&#8220;So what are you making for dinner tonight?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;We are having a baked SWEET potato bar.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;WOW.  What a great idea!&#8221; thinking, <em>I am so inadequate compared to her greatness</em>.</p>
<p>I swear, it will go down just like that.</p>
<p>5) Get your children involved.  If it is their idea they won&#8217;t complain and will probably eat.</p>
<p>Just last night one of my children began whining, &#8220;You never make us pizza bagels anymore.&#8221;  I honestly had no idea that anyone was pining for pizza bagels.  In my mind they were something I threw together after a long day when I had failed to plan and had run out of ideas.  So I immediately added to my shopping list: plain bagels, pizza sauce, grated mozzarella cheese.  </p>
<p>That is an under five minute dinner.</p>
<p>Up next, some recipes which require no cooking.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love fajitas.  I have a friend that I go shopping with every year for Christmas presents and we always go out for fajitas.</p>
<p>This recipe is quite possibly THE best chicken marinade, EVER. In the history of marinades. I have to force myself to only make it occasionally, so that I don&#8217;t get sick of it. That is how good it is.  It is also a versatile marinade.  I use it for making chicken fajitas.  For grilling chicken and putting it on a salad.  Or for grilling and making it into a sandwich on some nice crusty bread.</p>
<p>Tonight when I was putting away the leftover food I asked my son to wrap up the rest of the chicken and he said, &#8220;Can&#8217;t I just eat it?&#8221;  So you know it must be good, because Lord knows teenage boys just don&#8217;t eat anything.  Oh wait, nevermind.  It is delicious though.  I promise.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0145 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2650190100/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3107/2650190100_582a646050.jpg" alt="DSC_0145" width="381" height="254" /></a></p>
<p>These are the cast of characters, minus the soy sauce which I inexplicably forgot to put in the photo.</p>
<p>I usually double this recipe and use it for a huge family pack of chicken breasts.  You can do that and then freeze half of the chicken with the marinade in a ziploc bag.  Or you can use the recipe as is and make a &#8220;normal&#8221; sized package.</p>
<p>I fillet my chicken breasts in half to make them less thick so that they will cook evenly on the grill.  Really you should do this too so that your chicken doesn&#8217;t get all burnt on the outside.</p>
<p>You need:</p>
<p>2/3 cup water<br />
1/3 cup soy sauce<br />
1 1/2 T Worstershire sauce<br />
1 cup honey<br />
1/4 tsp ginger<br />
1/4 tsp garlic powder</p>
<p>crushed red pepper, optional and to taste</p>
<p>Mix in a bowl or ziploc bag.  Add the chicken.  Let marinate overnight.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0148 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2650190136/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/2650190136_dc99001668.jpg" alt="DSC_0148" width="378" height="252" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>The next day slice up an onion and a couple of peppers.  Saute them until they are tender.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0152 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2650190170/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3182/2650190170_36523c3a69.jpg" alt="DSC_0152" width="378" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>There is my chicken marinating in my IKEA bowl that I love.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0153 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2650190190/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3284/2650190190_eb305371e1.jpg" alt="DSC_0153" width="375" height="249" /></a></p>
<p>My son took over doing the peppers and onions.  Maybe because he was tired if me taking photos already and wanted to just eat dinner.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0157 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2650190330/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3049/2650190330_0ae50a05ea.jpg" alt="DSC_0157" width="366" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>After the chicken is cooked, I slice it into strips.  Served with sour cream, salsa, grated mexican cheese, and whatever other fixin&#8217;s strike your fancy.  Don&#8217;t you love my paper plates?  We are so  class-ay.   Honestly, without a working kitchen I can&#8217;t tolerate all the dishes for every single meal.  Al Gore would forgive me, I know he would.</p>
<p>Heat your tortillas and wrap &#8216;em up.</p>
<p>Insert a photo of wild children eating their fajitas.  This recipe received 18 enthusiastic thumbs up.</p>
<p>Here I am cooking on my grill, roughing it like a regular frontier woman.  My life is soooo HARD.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0232 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2650199074/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2650199074_25113b2827.jpg" alt="DSC_0232" width="373" height="249" /></a></p>

My children love this. LOVE.  There really isn&#8217;t much not to love about it as long as you like peanut butter.  I have several different versions of this recipe, but this one is my children&#8217;s favorite and it is the simplest to prepare.  A win-win situation of you ask me.

<p>My children love this. LOVE.  There really isn&#8217;t much not to love about it as long as you like peanut butter.  I have several different versions of this recipe, but this one is my children&#8217;s favorite and it is the simplest to prepare.  A win-win situation of you ask me.<span id="more-141"></span></p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2415379692/" title="DSC_0059 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2002/2415379692_74243d20b4.jpg" alt="DSC_0059" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>1/2 cup natural peanut butter<br />
1/2 cup water<br />
2T soy sauce, or Tamari (which is basically gluten free soy sauce)<br />
1T brown sugar (if your peanut butter is sweetened skip this)<br />
2T veg oil<br />
3 cloves garlic, minced OR 6 cloves <a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/orderingdisorder/2008/03/20/hummus-quick-and-easy/" target="_blank">ROASTED garlic</a><br />
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper (use more if you would like this anything but mild)<br />
4cups broccoli<br />
4 chicken breasts</p>
<p>Mix all the ingredients through the crushed red pepper into a mixing bowl.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2415379720/" title="DSC_0060 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3130/2415379720_a8f857b781.jpg" alt="DSC_0060" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>Yum, roasted garlic.  Just doing my part to keep vampires at bay.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2415379732/" title="DSC_0061 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3220/2415379732_19a0e943f5.jpg" alt="DSC_0061" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>It will take a few minutes of vigorous mixing in order for it to become smooth.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2415379748/" title="DSC_0062 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3143/2415379748_21d0773504.jpg" alt="DSC_0062" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>Cover this and set aside.  The longer you set it aside, the more the flavors will meld together and the spiciness will come through.  If you think to make this in the morning, even better.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2415379778/" title="DSC_0064 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/2415379778_6462d78933.jpg" alt="DSC_0064" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>Cut the crowns off of your broccoli.  Look broccoli up in the dictionary and vow to remember how it is spelled this time.  Write it one last time in an effort to commit it to memory&#8230; broccoli.   There.</p>
<p>I like to cut them into bite sized pieces so that I don&#8217;t have to cut it up at the table.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2415379682/" title="DSC_0058 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2415379682_a22eabcef6.jpg" alt="DSC_0058" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>I fillet the chicken breast, as usual, and then slice it into strips.  This makes cooking the chicken so much easier.  Pour a little bit of oil into the pan, just enough so that it doesn&#8217;t stick, perhaps a tablespoon or two.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2414574367/" title="DSC_0065 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3141/2414574367_690e76101d.jpg" alt="DSC_0065" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>After the chicken is slightly browned on the outside remove it from the heat.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2414574377/" title="DSC_0066 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2294/2414574377_4688acdfee.jpg" alt="DSC_0066" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>Dump the broccoli on top.  Add about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of water to the skillet.  Return it to low heat WITH A TIGHT FITTING LID IN PLACE (sorry &#8217;bout that omission) and let the chicken and broccoli steam.  This ensures that the chicken is cooked all the way through, yet remains moist, while the broccoli cooks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2414574383/" title="DSC_0068 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3221/2414574383_cb83d97bfd.jpg" alt="DSC_0068" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>Remove from heat.  Oooooo, steamy.  You can lean over and give yourself an impromptu facial if you desire, though you may get odd looks from your family.  Not that I would know.</p>
<p>Almost all of the water should be gone now.  If there is a small but left don&#8217;t worry about it.  If there is still a significant amount just pour it off.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2414574391/" title="DSC_0069 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3185/2414574391_8d9a46b7bb.jpg" alt="DSC_0069" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>Dump the peanut butter mixture into the skillet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2414574415/" title="DSC_0070 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2414574415_dc41acfea2.jpg" alt="DSC_0070" height="229" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>Gently stir to coat.  If you are too rough all the broccoli will break and that will be a tragedy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2415431950/" title="DSC_0071 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2221/2415431950_49763528c0.jpg" alt="DSC_0071" height="229" width="342" /></a></p>
<p>Serve with rice.  Or <a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/orderingdisorder/2008/02/21/in-the-crockpot-chicken-curry-with-sweet-potatoes-and-coconut-rice/">coconut rice</a> if you feeling crazy.  Enjoy.</p>
<p>This is one of those meals that tastes just as good (better?) reheated.  I ate it for lunch the next two days and was wishing I could have had it again today.  Instead I had hummus.  No, I am not sick of it yet.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264367205/" title="cupcake by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2262/2264367205_f185ae1495.jpg" alt="cupcake" height="457" width="352" /></a></p>
<p>Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>My children have eaten sweethearts, chocolate, and cupcakes for breakfast.  Apparently Valentine&#8217;s Day is the national holiday for putting yourself into a sugar coma.</p>
<p>I am not going to write about making cupcakes today.  Instead I am going to share our family&#8217;s beloved chili recipe.  Because let&#8217;s face it, nothing says I love you like a meal that requires <a href="http://www.beanogas.com/" target="_blank">beano</a>.  Flatulence: the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p><span id="more-124"></span></p>
<p>One of the things that I love about chili is that it isn&#8217;t a fussy recipe.  You can add more of something, less of another, omit ingredients, or substitute your own.  You really can&#8217;t mess it up. I promise.  This version is very mild.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<p><strong>1 16oz can red kidney beans<br />
1 16 oz can white beans<br />
2 cans crushed tomatoes<br />
1 green pepper<br />
1 onion<br />
2 cloves garlic, crushed<br />
1 1/2 lbs ground beef<br />
frozen corn niblets, optional</strong></p>
<p><strong>2-3 T chili powder<br />
1tsp ground black pepper<br />
1 tsp cumin<br />
1 tsp paprika<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
1/2 tsp cinnamon</strong></p>
<p><strong>Serve with any or none of the following:<br />
Tostitos<br />
taco shells<br />
sour cream<br />
shredded cheese</strong></p>
<p>The recipe serves approx 6 adults.  I double it and we have leftovers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264360359/" title="chili1 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2119/2264360359_d4cf68326f.jpg" alt="chili1" height="235" width="341" /></a></p>
<p>I love green peppers.  And I thought since they are out of season here, along with everything except snow, and I paid $3.89 a pound for them, that they deserved their own photo.  Please admire them.</p>
<p>I half expected to find gold nuggets inside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264360363/" title="chili2 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2378/2264360363_81129ebc03.jpg" alt="chili2" height="235" width="342" /></a></p>
<p>I almost hated to chop them up.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264360369/" title="chili3 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2234/2264360369_8df989f7c7.jpg" alt="chili3" height="238" width="343" /></a></p>
<p>Dump them into your skillet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264360373/" title="chili4 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2148/2264360373_88b20365ea.jpg" alt="chili4" height="249" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>Now peel and chop your onion.  If you have one of these handy choppers even your toddler can help.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264360375/" title="chili5 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2147/2264360375_aa1f920dae.jpg" alt="chili5" height="248" width="338" /></a></p>
<p>And help he will.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264360379/" title="chili6 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2311/2264360379_e884121b80.jpg" alt="chili6" height="250" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>Until the onions have been pulverized into a liquidy unrecognizable mass.  But that is fine.  (See above where I said you can NOT ruin this recipe.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2265157228/" title="chili7 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2094/2265157228_41f3672dfe.jpg" alt="chili7" height="230" width="334" /></a></p>
<p>Dump the onions into your skillet also.  Add a dash of oil, I prefer extra virgin olive oil because I am channeling my inner virgin, but feel free to use whatever kind of oil you have.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2265157230/" title="chili8 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2270/2265157230_dc4033c7ef.jpg" alt="chili8" height="232" width="336" /></a></p>
<p>Have you ever seen such gorgeous ground beef?  Yes, this is from the organically raised, hand-fed, coddled, loved, and swaddled with silk cow.     At least until the day it was slaughtered.  It still cost less than those green peppers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2265157234/" title="chili9 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2142/2265157234_435b04424d.jpg" alt="chili9" height="238" width="346" /></a></p>
<p>After the onions and peppers grow a tiny bit soft, throw the ground beef into the skillet with them (and your garlic! I have no photo of the garlic because I was mysteriously out of garlic and forced to use garlic powder.)  Saute it all up until the meat is no longer pink.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2265157236/" title="chili10 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2370/2265157236_a2f00497d8.jpg" alt="chili10" height="239" width="348" /></a></p>
<p>Open your cans of crushed tomatoes.  If you like whole tomatoes in your chili you can also add a can of whole tomatoes, drained.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2265157240/" title="chili11 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2172/2265157240_a69b8906bf.jpg" alt="chili11" height="251" width="342" /></a></p>
<p>Open your cans of beans and rinse them thoroughly.  Trust me on the rinsing.  One time I decided to just dump them in and I think I alone was responsible for the damage to the ozone layer that day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2265157242/" title="chili12 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2102/2265157242_51acef7790.jpg" alt="chili12" height="231" width="336" /></a></p>
<p>Mix all the ingredients together in your stock pot or crock pot.  Add all the spices.  And let it simmer away on low.</p>
<p>Crockpot on low can cook from 5 to 10 hours.   The longer it cooks the softer the bean become.  On the stove top I usually only cook it 4-5 hours and stir it frequently.  I really prefer doing the chili in the crockpot as I don&#8217;t have to worry about things burning on the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p>If you are going to add corn, put it into the pot before serving.  I usually turn off the crockpot or stove 20 minutes before dinner so that the food can cool slightly and stir the corn in then.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264367203/" title="chili13 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2108/2264367203_b575989607.jpg" alt="chili13" height="255" width="347" /></a></p>
<p>I also remake the leftovers of this meal into a multitude of different things.  I&#8217;ll make a batch of rice and then toss this into cooked rice with a can of diced tomatoes, add some additional spices, and viola a &#8220;Spanish&#8221; rice to serve as a side dish.  Or use it as is for filling an omelete with a bunch of shredded cheese.</p>
<p>This is a bonus Valentine&#8217;s day punch recipe that my daughter said I should write about.   When we had our Super Bowl feast the kids all got to pick a food and my 7 yr old son picked this punch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264367209/" title="punch by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2286/2264367209_2ac3e5166b.jpg" alt="punch" height="253" width="344" /></a></p>
<p>In our huge salad turned punch bowl I dumped two containers of raspberry sherbert.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264367215/" title="punch2 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2224/2264367215_aea8c5d69e.jpg" alt="punch2" height="253" width="345" /></a></p>
<p>Then I poured a 2L bottle of ginger ale on top of it.  But I&#8217;ll tell you a little secret&#8230; you can use your ice cream scooper and put a small scoop of sherbet into a punch glass and then pour some ginger ale into the glass.  That way you don&#8217;t have to drink yourself sick, unless you want to.   Feel free to add some vodka to your glass or any other adults over the age of 21 and not driving.</p>
<p>Unless you don&#8217;t want to, then you can just add it to mine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2264367217/" title="punch3 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2077/2264367217_7378a3df99.jpg" alt="punch3" height="249" width="341" /></a></p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Child working her little fingers to the bone, optional.</p>

<p>But really why not give her photographic evidence to bring to her therapist years from now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2244881904/" title="stew6 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2258/2244881904_54e4d5a1e5.jpg" alt="stew6" height="241" width="351" /></a></p>
<p>For the tomatoes I like to use the whole tomatoes instead of the diced.  The only reason being that I can then easily scoop the whole tomatoes out of the bowls of children who think tomatoes are the anti-christ and will snatch the very souls from their bodies if the tomatoes even so much as float there harmlessly in the bowl.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2244083589/" title="stew7 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/2244083589_bfb4af17df.jpg" alt="stew7" height="240" width="349" /></a></p>
<p>Likewise for the onions I just peel and quarter so the large onion pieces can be picked out.</p>
<p>I should really call this Deconstruction Stew, a favorite of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida" target="_blank">Jacques Derrida.</a>  Don&#8217;t you love how I threw this little tidbit of literary criticism in here?  I still have no clue what deconstructive literary criticism is all about, but let no one say that it stopped me from writing numerous papers in grad school on the very subject.</p>
<p>Oh wait, but we were talking about making beef stew.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2244083585/" title="stew8 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2167/2244083585_6aa63c8ddf.jpg" alt="stew8" height="234" width="340" /></a></p>
<p>On a plate pour out some cornstarch, or you can use flour if you are glutenly challenged (Yes, I made up that word), season it with some freshly ground pepper and sea salt.  See those cute little containers I have?  They come with a little grinder as a top, which I love.  You are going to dredge the beef in the mixture.</p>
<p>Dredge? What does that mean, woman?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2244083581/" title="stew9 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2364/2244083581_ea6744bba5.jpg" alt="stew9" height="237" width="345" /></a></p>
<p>Just drop your beef in there, roll it around, and coat it.</p>
<p>Drop it all into your pot, a crock pot works great too, set the stove to low and let it cook all day long.  Occasionally you will want to go and stir it.  The delicious smell wafting from it won&#8217;t let you forget.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2244083573/" title="stew10 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2039/2244083573_96005b36e0.jpg" alt="stew10" height="237" width="345" /></a></p>
<p>About half an hour before you want to eat, make a mixture of 1/3 cup of cornstarch and and equal amount of cold water.  Stir it up and pour into the stew.  This will thicken the stew.   If it isn&#8217;t as thick as you would like, you can do this again.</p>
<p>Do not think you can skip this step and just pour the cornstarch into the pot.    It will just become all lumpy.</p>
<p>Salt and pepper to taste before serving.  Remember we haven&#8217;t added any salt to the broth so you may need to use quite a bit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2244083565/" title="stew by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2314/2244083565_b149f5b52b.jpg" alt="stew" height="237" width="345" /></a></p>
<p>Serve with a nice crusty French bread and butter.</p>
<p>If you have a nice cabana boy to bring it to you, even better.</p>

<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love beef stew?  Especially on the cold gray winter days that make you cold just looking out your window.  Those of you who live in warm sunny climates will just have to turn your air conditioners up and pretend.  Poor you.<span id="more-121"></span></p>
<p>The base of any good soup or stew is the stock used to make it.  And there is no commercial stock that can compare to home made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but that sounds so hard.  And so complicated.&#8221;  you are saying.  I hear you.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingcloset/" target="_blank">Susan</a>, you can do it.   I promise it isn&#8217;t difficult.  It is time consuming as the stock will need to simmer for an entire day, so you&#8217;ll have to plan around that.  But, you can make a huge batch and freeze some for the next time.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t really have to do anything to it all day, just be home while it simmers away.  Oh, and occassionally wipe the drool off your chin.</p>
<p>I am all about taking short cuts, because a) I am lazy.  and b) Well, I am lazy and have poor planning skills.  But the extra effort makes this taste so much better.  It is not all salty and MSG laden with ingredients you can not pronounce.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry.  If you don&#8217;t want to make your own stock, you can purchase it already made.  Just skip this post.  Also, pretend I didn&#8217;t say salty and MSG laden and gross.  Oh, I didn&#8217;t say that?  Well I was thinking it.   Come back Thursday when I will post the recipe for the delicious beef stew pictured above.</p>
<p>4 pounds beef soup bones<br />
2 large onions, peeled and quartered<br />
5 medium carrots, cut into large chunks (I cut 2-3&#8243; off the fat ends of a bag of carrots and use those)<br />
5 medium celery ribs, cut into large chunks (I cut the end off the entire bunch and use all the less than perfect ones)<br />
6 large garlic cloves, peeled and tossed in whole<br />
basil<br />
thyme<br />
freshly ground pepper</p>
<p>salt- I don&#8217;t add salt at this stage.  I prefer to add it when I use the stock to make a soup or stew.</p>
<p>Where to get soup bones?  You know, if stealing them from neighborhood dogs isn&#8217;t your thing.</p>
<p>They should sell them at your local grocery store.  If not ask the butcher if he has any that are going to be thrown away.  They are obscenely inexpensive.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to save the bones from meat dishes you make and store them in a bag in your freezer.  Something I have done, uh, never.</p>
<p>Turn your oven to 450 and put your soup bones in a baking pan for about 30 minutes, or until they turn brown.</p>
<p>In the mean time, chop the veggies and toss them and the spices in your large stock pot.  Fill the pot about 3/4ths of the way with water.  About 16 cups of water I would guess.</p>
<p>Once the bones are done roasting, toss into the pot.</p>
<p>Now at this point you can deglaze the baking pan.  Deglaze is a fancy schmancy word for add a bit of water or red wine to the stuck on bits and drippings in your pan and scrape it with a spatula over some heat.</p>
<p>But, as I mentioned above, I am lazy and therefore I just scrape the drippings and cooked on pieces off with a spatula right over the stock pot and call it a day.  You can take a swig from the wine bottle instead.  You have totally earned it.</p>
<p>Turn the pot on high until it boils.  Then turn it down low.  As low as you can turn it.  Put the lid on and go about your merry way.  Every couple of hours check it and add more water if necessary.  Let it cook all day, as in 10 hours.  Turn it off and let it cool on the stove.  The put the whole thing in your fridge overnight.  or if you are lucky enough to live somewhere cold, put it outside on a screened porch or the middle of your driveway or your neighbor&#8217;s front stoop.  You know anywhere cold and convenient.</p>
<p>The next morning you want to carefully open the pot up and scrape off the layer of fat that has formed on the top.  Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t get every last bit of it, a little fat won&#8217;t kill you.</p>
<p>Get out your colander .  Make sure you have it set inside of another pan to catch the broth as it strains through.  Should I say it again?  Because it has happened before.  Not that<em> I</em> would know anything about that.  <em>Ahem</em>.</p>
<p>You will be left with something that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2244881928/" title="stew2 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2139/2244881928_f22bc477bc.jpg" alt="stew2" height="243" width="353" /></a></p>
<p>I had a lot of fun leaving it out on the table and telling the children that it was going to be dinner tonight.  Then I made one of them carry it out to our compost pile or, as I like to call it, our wild animal feeding pile.</p>
<p>Your beef stock will look like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2244881922/" title="stew3 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2410/2244881922_24e45f2820.jpg" alt="stew3" height="241" width="348" /></a></p>
<p>Pour half into a container and put in the freezer.</p>
<p>The other half we are going to use to make a fabulous beef stew.  Every single one of my children give it a stamp of approval, a rare thing indeed.</p>
<p>Here, take another look at it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2244083565/" title="stew by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2314/2244083565_b149f5b52b.jpg" alt="stew" height="237" width="345" /></a></p>
<p>Oh my.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2216762666/" title="potato-chicken6 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2400/2216762666_8341024d9c.jpg" alt="potato-chicken6" height="267" width="388" /></a></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Chris and I love roasted vegetables.  Specifically I love roasted potatoes.  I don&#8217;t think my family shares my undying potato love, however.  Unless saying that you are going to wish for a potato famine is a compliment.</p>
<p>I have a problem with getting stuck on a certain food and making it over and over again until I am sick of it and/or my family stages a revolt.  Summer 2007 will always be known as the Summer of Hummus.  Just ask <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingcloset/" target="_blank">Susan</a>, she told me on the phone the other day that she hasn&#8217;t eaten hummus since July when we spent a week together and I forced her to eat it every day.</p>
<p>And this is the Winter of the Potato.  Amen.<span id="more-118"></span></p>
<p>This is one of those recipes that is so easy and so versatile.  You really can&#8217;t mess it up.</p>
<p>The ingredients:</p>
<p>Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed, skin left on<br />
Big carrots, scrubbed, unpeeled<br />
Onion<br />
Sea Salt</p>
<p>Chicken breast<br />
Olive oil</p>
<p>1 	teaspoon dried rosemary<br />
1 	teaspoon garlic powder<br />
1 	teaspoon dried parsley<br />
1 	teaspoon chili powder<br />
1 	teaspoon paprika<br />
1 	teaspoon powdered chipotle pepper</p>
<p>In the morning I take a large ziploc bag and pour some olive oil into it.  Then I dump all the spices into the bag.  (You can use whatever spices you like, add more chili powder and chipotle pepper if you like things more spicy or use none at all if you don&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>The I take the frozen chicken breasts and stick them in the ziploc bag to marinate on the counter.  Every time I walk by I squeeze the bag and rub the spices around.</p>
<p>Back to the potatoes and carrots.  After you scrub them you need to cut them up.  Like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2216762664/" title="potato-chicken5 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2003/2216762664_b3e7ee8668.jpg" alt="potato-chicken5" height="264" width="383" /></a></p>
<p>If you do not have little <strike>slaves</strike> helpers, you will have to do it yourself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2216762660/" title="potato-chicken4 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2276/2216762660_dc9a071a9b.jpg" alt="potato-chicken4" height="289" width="381" /></a></p>
<p>Holding the carrot up to your nose and pretending you are a snowman is optional, though highly recommended.  As is singing the song Frosty the Snowman, because then you will realize that Frosty has a button nose.  Why does he have a button nose?  He totally should have a carrot nose.   Speculate that maybe because he smokes a corn cob pipe a carrot nose would be a fire hazard.</p>
<p>Put one carrot aside in the refrigerator to save for the next snowman that you build.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2216762656/" title="potato-chicken3 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2223/2216762656_231c85c301.jpg" alt="potato-chicken3" height="268" width="387" /></a></p>
<p>Put all of the chopped carrots and potatoes in a baking dish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2216762650/" title="potato-chicken2 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2264/2216762650_d2a9983c9b.jpg" alt="potato-chicken2" height="265" width="385" /></a></p>
<p>You know what, toss in an onion.  I like to leave the onion in big chunks so that I can easily remove them from the plates of the picky children.</p>
<p>Pour olive oil over this and mix it up really well so all the pieces are coated.  Sprinkle liberally with sea salt.</p>
<p>You are now going to cover it with tinfoil and put it in the oven set to 350 for an hour.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2216762646/" title="potato-chicken by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2023/2216762646_fc588420c5.jpg" alt="potato-chicken" height="268" width="389" /></a></p>
<p>When the hour is up, pull the baking dish out and put the chicken breasts right there on the top.  Pour the whole bag in.  Cover with tinfoil and pop back in the oven for 30 minutes, or until your breasts are done.  Chicken breasts that is.  Not your breasts.  Those probably are done.  Are you there God? It&#8217;s me Chris, still waiting for those breasts you know.</p>
<p>Take out of the oven, remove the chicken breasts.  Stick the baking dish back in the oven set to broil for five minutes or so.   You don&#8217;t have to do this part, but I like them to get crunchy on the outside.  Just don&#8217;t forget about them or they will burn.</p>
<p>(You can do this with any kind of meat.  Last weekend I used a pork rib roast.  Which in some ways was easier because it took the same amount of time for the roast to bake as it did the potatoes.  Not the same spices though.  I used sea salt, rosemary, thyme and garlic.  I also made little slits in the pork roast and put garlic gloves in the little pockets.)</p>
<p>My favorite part about this meal is the leftovers.</p>
<p>The next morning I take the potatoes and fry them up in a pan , like hash browns.  I am wishing I had some of this leftover right now.</p>
<p>So c&#8217;mon and join me in the Winter of the Potato.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did I say I was going to clean out and organize my cabinets this weekend?  Oooooops.  I, uh, didn&#8217;t feel like it.  Probably because I had huge piles of laundry stacked on my counter and I would not have been able to take everything out of the cabinets unless I first folded and put away all the laundry.  And, um, I didn&#8217;t feel like doing that.</p>
<p>My husband loves to cook.  On the weekends when he is home is always fixing fun foods for the kids, and most of the time they are somewhat healthy, because he also hates junk food.  Yes, he is like a robot.  A robot who cooks, does dishes, and irons.  No, you can&#8217;t have him.  Though I will consider selling him for the right price.  Oh, I am just joking, honey.</p>
<p>When my kids are hungry between meals I am apt to tell them go forage through the cabinets.  I think fending for yourself is a good skill to learn.  My kids will be able to survive in any frat house.</p>
<p>My husband plans out snacks.  And I got to thinking that with a little extra effort on my part I could have something that would be more nutritious to offer during the witching hour when dinner was being made.</p>
<p>This weekend he made deviled eggs, or as the kids like to call them Devil Eggs followed by a cackle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2212646850/" title="DSC_00021 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2396/2212646850_847bfd835a.jpg" alt="DSC_00021" height="256" width="382" /></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t make eggs since I am allergic to them.  In fact, I don&#8217;t even like to look at eggs.</p>
<p>I always thought that Deviled eggs were difficult to make.  I don&#8217;t know why I thought this.  Maybe I was thrown by the use of a pastry bag to squirt the yolks back into the white part?  Maybe because it was a multi-step process?  Maybe because I never really got close enough to look at them?</p>
<p>Whatever it was, I have seen the light.  These are so easy.  The kids helped do them.  We didn&#8217;t use a pastry bag, obviously, and instead just scooped the filling back in with a spoon.<span id="more-117"></span></p>
<p>For six eggs:</p>
<p>¼ cup Mayonnaise<br />
teaspoon dijon mustard<br />
½ teaspoon white vinegar<br />
1/8 teaspoon salt<br />
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper<br />
Paprika for garnish</p>
<p>First you hard boil the eggs.  Once they cool off a bit, which can be helped by submerging the eggs in cold water once they are hard boiled.<br />
Peel them, (<em>Really Chris?  We should peel the eggs?  Yes, I state the obvious for you because I love you, Internet.</em>)</p>
<p>Slice the eggs in half length wise and scoop out the yolk into a bowl.</p>
<p>Mash the yolks up with the above ingredients.</p>
<p>Replace the filling back into the eggs.</p>
<p>Eat.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebigyellowhouse/2212646854/" title="DSC_00062 by notes from the trenches, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2288/2212646854_713b23e97e.jpg" alt="DSC_00062" height="500" width="334" /></a></p>
<p>For a spicier version: Add a couple teaspoons of horseradish and two tablespoons of relish.  Cut the mayo by half.  My  kids liked the spicier version better.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of quick snack foods that I make:<br />
<strong><br />
Peanut butter tortillas</strong>:</p>
<p>Spread peanut butter on half of a round flour tortilla.  Sprinkle a few mini chocolate chips or mini marshmallows. (Just a few!)  Wrap it in tin foil and place in the oven for a few minutes.  We also make these over a fire outside in the firepit.</p>
<p><strong>Peanut butter fruit dip:</strong></p>
<p>Mix together:<br />
1/3 cup peanut butter<br />
2 tablespoons milk<br />
2 tablespoons honey<br />
1 tablespoon water<br />
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p>Serve this in a ramekin with some apple slices for dipping.</p>
<p><strong>Banana Pops</strong></p>
<p>For this next recipe you must have a toothpick.  Yes, it is required to eat the little banana slices with, according to my children.  And if the toothpick has that fancy cellophane paper on the tip you get extra points, because one day when they are angry teenagers you can throw it back at them.  &#8220;Hey, I bought those fancy toothpicks for you, remember?  And they cost me an extra eighty-three cents, so don&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t love you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Banana slices served with a ramekin of vanilla yogurt.  (Real yogurt, not that artificially colored sugar ladened junk that is marketed to kids.  Oooops, is that a rant I feel coming on?)</p>
<p>You pop the banana with the toothpick (hence the name of the recipe) and dip it in the yogurt and then eat it.</p>
<p>As I am typing this my little kids are sitting next to me eating carrot sticks and dipping them into Ranch dressing.  Though I am trying unsuccessfully to convince my 3 yr old son that the carrot is supposed to be eaten also, not just used as a vehicle to get the dressing into your mouth.</p>
