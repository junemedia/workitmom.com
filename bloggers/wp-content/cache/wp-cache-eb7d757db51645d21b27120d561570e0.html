			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="float: right" src="http://i233.photobucket.com/albums/ee137/lionandmagicboy/bradybunch.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="276" />Newsflash: families, like all relationships, take work to make really awesome. Just because you carried these little people inside your body and you love them more than anything doesn&#8217;t mean you will navigate the roads of life together without some bumps. That&#8217;s where the family meeting comes in.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Family meeting? Isn&#8217;t that like when the Brady Bunch came together to diffuse the tension created by deciding how to spend the trading stamps they saved? (spoiler: after a tense house-of-cards build-off, the boys and girls decided to give up their opposing ideas — rowboat! sewing machine! — and instead buy something the whole family could enjoy — a 13-inch color TV, w00t!)</p>
<p>Yeah, well, no. Family meetings are like the rainbow sprinkles of the donut world. They make everything sparklier. Tastier. More fun. Okay, maybe a food analogy doesn&#8217;t work here. But these are things you can have from holding effective family meetings:<span id="more-288"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Unity</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Togetherness</li>
<li>Getting things done</li>
<li>More love</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>1. Make meetings regular.</strong></div>
<div>Decide to make your family a priority. Set aside regular time (45-60 minutes) that every family member can count on and make space for. Meetings once a week are highly effective — items up for discussion can be saved between meetings and addressed all in one fell swoop, rather than chasing after everyone piecemeal through the week. You&#8217;ll make your meetings brief enough, fun enough, and effective enough that everyone will want to forego other activities so you can be together.</div>
<div><strong>2. Have a structure.</strong></div>
<div>I like the sandwich technique: the &#8220;bread&#8221; is something that feels good, and the &#8220;filling&#8221; is the meat of your meeting. This technique works best when every member participates equally. Sample beginning &#8220;bread&#8221; ideas:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>one thing you feel grateful for</li>
<li>one thing you appreciate about other family members</li>
<li>recount a family highlight from the past week</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>End your meeting in a similar way. Ending &#8220;bread&#8221; ideas:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>something you learned about another family member in the meeting</li>
<li>an action you will take the next week</li>
<li>something you look forward to in the next week</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>3. Offer an agenda.</strong></div>
<div>Pick one major or 2-3 minor items that will be the focus of the meeting. With kids about 5 or older, you can let everyone know beforehand what&#8217;s on the table and solicit ideas. For younger kids, be inviting but set boundaries about what you find important to talk about.</div>
<div><strong>4. Talk nice.</strong></div>
<div>No blaming, name-calling, or shaming. Everyone is respectful. Allow feelings to come up — after all, you&#8217;re human — and take time to cool off if necessary. There are tons of resources for effective and kind communication, like <a href="http://www.cnvc.org/">Non-Violent Communication</a>, a method of talking about feelings and treating people with kindness and respect.</div>
<div><strong>5. Democratize. Or not.</strong></div>
<div>I love the idea of an equal vote for all. But sometimes it doesn&#8217;t make sense to let your 4-year-old decide what to do with your end-of-year bonus, for example. Be mindful of how you want to divvy up the vote when you are making decisions that affect the whole family. Let everyone know how it&#8217;s going to roll — don&#8217;t let kids think they have an equal vote of they really don&#8217;t. Be up front and consistent about your choices, and try to leave room for change when it feels right. (Note to my Mom &amp; Dad: would this have been so hard?)</div>
<div><strong>6. End with dessert.</strong></div>
<div>One way to get everyone on board with the whole family meeting thing and to help give it momentum is to plan a fun family activity after every meeting. Business first, then play! You&#8217;re already all together, so why not play a board game together or head outside for a round of Tag?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="float: right;margin: 4px" src="http://i233.photobucket.com/albums/ee137/lionandmagicboy/baby.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />This is totally going to come as a surprise, but I am here to tell you right now that Babies Are Hard. Not hard like you can cut diamonds with them hard, but hard like, Ohhhh, they&#8217;re so haaaaaarrd, like the way Barbie thinks math is. And! Get this. Not only are babies hard, but kids in general. Hard!</p>
<p>Hey. Can you spare me a tiny detour segue thing? Because I really wanted to share <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/jamie-and-jeffs-birth-plan">this</a> with you. And by <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/jamie-and-jeffs-birth-plan">this</a>, I mean the awesome <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/jamie-and-jeffs-birth-plan">Jamie and Jeff&#8217;s Birth Plan over at McSweeney&#8217;s</a>. Go on. I&#8217;ll wait. Because 1) in my world it relates to this post and 2) how can you NOT weep from pure happiness at birth plan talking points that refer to Zoey Deschanel, Oregon Tilth, Gisele Bundchen, texting, and placenta donation?<span id="more-287"></span></p>
<p>Back to the whining. So, in my world, if you take Jamie and Jeff&#8217;s Birth Plan (and all its social implications, because, this stuff has to come from somewhere) and add to it <a href="http://jezebel.com/5923225/yes-all-new-parents-are-lame-and-selfish-but-cmon-man">Yes, All New Parents Are Lame and Selfish But C&#8217;mon, Man</a>, over at Jezebel, and you get a picture of the future.</p>
<p>Defensive, crankypants twentysomething: sorry, Jezebel writer Tracy Moore, but I judge you. Your life-as-you-knew-it is over now, and your beautifully crafted, clever essay is not going to make me believe that you are not now trying to tell your former friends (Ghosts of the Past You) that they Just Don&#8217;t Get You, because, well, you MADE A PERSON and they did not? And that making a person (read: wearing baby poop, being eye-blindingly tired, and alienating your former friends because they can&#8217;t relate to your incessant talk about baby poop) is way more meaningful, then, say, inventing the thing that brings clean water to Africa?</p>
<p>Dear parents who might spawn again, and dear everyone who might one day have a baby, let&#8217;s be clear on one thing: you will probably never get just how hard it is to have a kid.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s biology.</p>
<p>If we really knew how hard it is to have kids, more of us wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>But we forget. We turn a blind eye. We smell babies&#8217; heads and necks. We start nesting. And we just know that we can do it. We will be awesome parents! We won&#8217;t make the mistakes our parents did, or we will and it will all turn out anyway. We forget how hard, because if we didn&#8217;t? If we remembered and really thought about this giant step we make when we put Tab A into Slot B and make a person? Then maybe we wouldn&#8217;t even be here. None of us would be here.</p>
<p>But we do. We do the Tab A/Slot B thing. We make people. And it is really hard. Because we care and we want to do it right.</p>
<p>So dear New Parents, you people who are trying to figure it out and have it make sense and have your life while you do this Make a Person thing, stop trying so hard. Stop whining about it. Don&#8217;t just suck it up and stuff it down, but start thinking about trust. Capital-T Trust, the kind that comes when you tap into eons of person-making experience of our collective ancestors and you remember that the little person in the crib over there is going to make it — maybe even despite your best efforts. That little person in the crib over there has a drive to survive. That&#8217;s why his neck smells like bottled awesome. That&#8217;s why she learns to smile right about the time you&#8217;re ready to throw her out the window from the crying, but you don&#8217;t because your heart is melted into a puddle on the floor and you are more in love with her than you ever thought you could love another person, because this person is part of you and that never stops.</p>
<p>Stop whining. Start Trusting.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="float: right" src="http://i233.photobucket.com/albums/ee137/lionandmagicboy/whenharrymetsally.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="317" />Nora Ephron made the 90&#8217;s. She created Meg Ryan out of thin air (sorry about how the lips turned out). At least, in my head she did.</p>
<p>I miss Nora Ephron already. You&#8217;ve probably heard the news that she died yesterday —  the pseudofeminist screenwriter and playwright responsible for the phrase, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have what she&#8217;s having.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 90&#8217;s are over. Meg Ryan&#8217;s lips now have their own orbits.<span id="more-286"></span></p>
<p>Nora&#8217;s most memorable characters mostly weren&#8217;t mothers. In fact, it&#8217;s safe to say that any of her characters played by Meg Ryan would have made awful mothers. Sally Albright from <em>When Harry Met Sally&#8230;</em>? Terrible mother, if she had been a mother. Julie from <em>Julie &amp; Julia</em>? A trainwreck of a mother. If she had been one.</p>
<p>Still, Nora Ephron totally got what motherhood was. Or more specifically, what motherhood had become — not a state of being as much as a thing that you did:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Parenting was not simply about raising a child, it was about transforming a child, force-feeding it like a foie gras goose, altering, modifying, modulating, manipulating, smoothing out, improving.</em></p>
<p>–&#8221;I Feel Bad About My Neck&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And now, motherhood is reduced to what we do:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Here’s what a parent is: A parent is a person who has children. Here’s what involved in being a parent: You love your children, you hang out with them from time to time, you throw balls, you read stories, you make sure they know which utensil is the salad fork, you teach them to say please and thank you, you see that they have an occasional haircut, and you ask if they did their homework.</em> – &#8220;I Feel Bad About My Neck&#8221;&#8216;</p></blockquote>
<p>The 90&#8217;s changed the face of parenting. Mothering. Baby Mozart. Prenatal preschool applications.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Suddenly, one day, there was this thing called parenting. Parenting was serious. Parenting was fierce. Parenting was solemn. Parenting was a participle, like going and doing and crusading and worrying; it was active, it was energetic, it was unrelenting. Parenting meant playing Mozart CDs while you were pregnant, doing without the epidural, and breast-feeding your child until it was old enough to unbutton your blouse. </em>–&#8221;Heartburn&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Nora Ephron didn&#8217;t write mothers into her screenplays because she was telling women to be something different, to do something else with this idea of motherhood.</p>
<p>I like to think about what might have happened to mothering had more women heard the message Nora Ephron delivered in her commencement address to the Wellesley&#8217;s 1996 graduating class. Here&#8217;s how she ended it (but read <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/26/norah-ephrons-commencement-96-address_n_1628832.html">the whole thing</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p><span><em>Whatever you choose, however many roads you travel, I hope that you choose not to be a lady. I hope you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there. And I also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women. Thank you. Good luck. The first act of your life is over. Welcome to the best years of your lives.</em></span></p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="float: right;margin: 4px" src="http://i233.photobucket.com/albums/ee137/lionandmagicboy/goodmom.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="346" />I just found out <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/persistence-learned-fathers-study/story?id=16571927#.T-Hrg47TUgY">I can blame my dad for my lack of persistence</a> and general success in life. Yay. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/persistence-learned-fathers-study/story?id=16571927#.T-Hrg47TUgY">A new study</a> suggests that strict and authoritarian parents raise crappy kids. Hi, Dad, I&#8217;m talking to you. It&#8217;s a relief, actually, to find out that my dad&#8217;s strict, critical, punishment-based fathering style wasn&#8217;t just something I&#8217;ve been able to point to and vow that I will do exactly the opposite with my own kids.</p>
<p>So what makes a good parent?<span id="more-285"></span></p>
<p>According to the study, the parents that raised kids who grew up to have traits of persistence, hope, independence, and self-esteem used a child-centered approach combining structure with a strong heart connection. These parents used techniques of day-to-day involvement, listening, nurturing, and encouraged autonomy and decision-making. They set appropriate boundaries and applied consistent and fair discipline, but often used their kids&#8217; failures as a teaching tool rather than as a punishment opp.</p>
<p>I know, right?  Tell us something we don&#8217;t already know?</p>
<p>The parenting style the study points to is called <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles">Authoritative</a>. Not to be confused with Authoritarian (hi, Dad). And it&#8230;rocks. Here&#8217;s a list of traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>high expectations of maturity</li>
<li>understand how child is feeling</li>
<li>helps child regulate emotions</li>
<li>independence is enouraged</li>
<li>(within appropriate limits)</li>
<li>lots of listening</li>
<li>kids make many decisions</li>
<li>and are allowed to fail, sometimes</li>
<li>fosters child&#8217;s natural talents + strengths</li>
</ul>
<div>There. Parenting made easy. You&#8217;re welcome.</div>
<div>PS. The actual day-to-day is harder to pull off. You knew that. But these are awesome things to aspire to.</div>
<div>PSS. You will mess up. More than once. Just make note and try to do it differently next time. No one said you have to be perfect.</div>

At a social gathering this weekend, a Texas father caught a casual acquaintance attempting to sexually abuse the dad&#8217;s four-year-old daughter, who had gone inside the house while everyone else was outside tending to horses. The dad reportedly punched the molester in the head repeatedly until he died. Local sheriff says he won&#8217;t press charges against the dad. And people are cheering.</p>
<p>Listen, the very thought of one of my children being molested or sexually abused by an adult makes me want to throw up. But the thought of punching someone in the head until they die? That makes me want to throw up more.<span id="more-284"></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is a case of which is more important, a child&#8217;s life — sure to suck mightily for years and years after sexual abuse and probably require therapy, anger management classes, and emotional work to have a hope of healing — or the life of the kind of person who would attempt to sexually abuse a four-year-old, for gosh sakes (what kind of terrible person does this?), but it does. It does beg the question. So I will ask: whose life is worth more? And who gets to decide?</p>
<p>You could argue that the abuser opted out of being treated on par with other human beings when he stepped over the line — way over the line — and attempted to abuse a little girl.</p>
<p>You could argue that, and you&#8217;d be right.</p>
<p>But what about the dad?</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t the dad have had, I don&#8217;t know, more self control? He KILLED a guy. As in, dead. The guy does not get to live his life.</p>
<p>I would do almost anything to protect my children. I suspect most of you would do the same. But kill a man? Unless the man seemed bent on killing ME or my family? Like I said, the thought makes me want to throw up. I can&#8217;t quite wrap my head over going from hey-get-that-guy-away-from-my-daughter-NOW to bashing in his head, repeatedly.</p>
<p>Can you? How far would you go to protect your kids?</p>

They WILL go off on their own and develop — what is it called? Oh — personality. And tastes. Of their own.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have cloned myself a Mini-Me.</p>
<p>Because I TRIED to make my kids like everything I like, really I did. I bought Tinker Toys and trotted out my old childhood Breyer horses. I spent hours trolling websites that help people like me recall the names of their favorite childhood books so I could read &#8220;Shadow Castle&#8221; and &#8220;Mystery of the Green Cat&#8221; to my spawn. I found copies of every Rankin-Bass Christmas-themed animated film.</p>
<p>But you know what?<span id="more-282"></span></p>
<p>Some of those things my kids liked. Some they did not. And they liked a ton of things that they discovered all on their own (hi, Star Wars, I&#8217;m talking to you).</p>
<p>Hah, you&#8217;re probably laughing now. I know this stuff isn&#8217;t rocket science. Kids like what they like. We influence them, sure, but they are still quirky little autonomous beings with their own quirky tastes.</p>
<p>Last night a mom-friend was talking about her daughter&#8217;s TV tastes. We talked about the fine line we parents walk letting our kids have &#8220;their&#8221; thing. Like, how much do you join in and take an interest without co-opting the whole thing? Or the flip side, not being involved enough and then finding out after the fact that your kid&#8217;s interest in animal husbandry has suddenly translated into adopting a goat for a year?</p>
<p>I think kids should have their thing. Many things, if possible.</p>
<p>I also believe that part of our job as parents is to show them what our things are — what we are passionate about.</p>
<p>After that is the tricky part. When you dreamed of having a daughter who shares your love of horses, of bonding over long rambling dusty trail rides but she wants to spend her weekends sitting on the floor in the bathroom painting watercolors and writing Twilight fan fic, there&#8217;s a wee pang in your heart, as much as you love your kid for the quirky autonomous little person that she is.</p>
<p>And then what if your kid&#8217;s passionate thing is something you just don&#8217;t think is awesome? For whatever reason? Like in the movie &#8220;Billy Elliot&#8221; about the kid whose passion was ballet dancing, much to the chagrin of his burly macho dad. Movies are full of this stuff — plucky, determined kids following their hearts despite the wishes of their parents, yet winning the parent&#8217;s love in the end. I think reality is less golden, less happy-ending. We parents really do have a hard time letting go of our dreams for our kids.</p>
<p>How do you handle the [weird, random, outrageous] tastes of your kids? Live and let live? Keeping a finger in the pie? I&#8217;ve noticed that at about age 12, kids seem to really need to assert their differences from us parents, so I encourage it while trying to keep communication. Not always easy, is it?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/parentingwithoutamanual/files/2012/05/caring-older-woman.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-281" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/parentingwithoutamanual/files/2012/05/caring-older-woman.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a>My mom lives in a nursing home. She probably wears diapers. When I phone her (she lives in California &#8212; I&#8217;m in Seattle), she always tells me the same things: &#8220;We have a lot of fun here. The people are really nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>My mom can&#8217;t remember what she did that day, or what she ate for lunch. She doesn&#8217;t know her roommate&#8217;s name. She remembers that a bus takes them into town from time to time and she can buy things. I imagine her standing at a glass counter, holding a little coin purse stuffed with a few folded bills, sliding coins across the counter to buy a weekly candy bar. In my imagination I can see the five-year-old Janey doing the same thing, only back then it was a nickel she slid across the counter instead of &#8212; how much do candy bars cost these days, anyway?</p>
<p>Some people would say I have lost my mother. I think I finally see who she is.<span id="more-280"></span></p>
<p>Women of a certain age &#8212; in our 30&#8217;s and 40&#8217;s and older &#8212; are having similar experiences as mine. I call it mothering our mothers. I wonder how you feel about that.</p>
<p>Not every woman&#8217;s mother develops Alzheimer&#8217;s like my mom has, but most of us go through an interesting journey with our mothers. When we are young, we are the child and they are the grownup. That part of our lives and the roles we play then are pretty clear. Then as adults we cross into peer territory, if we are lucky: two women comparing lives and supporting one another. And then, later still, the weird part: as they age, our mothers relax and even regress a bit while we grow wiser and stronger. That&#8217;s when it feels like mothering our mothers.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t recognize this switch in my relationship with my mother until it was painfully clear that she needed help (her house was ankle deep in piled-up mail and cat poop, a reality she had shamefacedly hidden in our phone calls but could no longer hide when I went to visit). But looking back I can see now that she needed mothering long before I knew it. But at 77 she needs mothering now. Lots of it. And I suspect that she is not alone in that need, that many of our mothers need our mothering, even if they are eyebright and chipper and playing tennis into their 80&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Many women naturally sink into the role of mothering their mothers. Why wouldn&#8217;t we? We are already mothering our children. Calling your mom to remind her of a doctor&#8217;s appointment or ask her how her new shoes are feeling isn&#8217;t a big stretch beyond wiping up a spilled bowl of Cheerios or listening to your preschooler tell a long story about the imaginary rabbit he saw on the playground.</p>
<p>I still wonder how this mother-your-mother thing works out for other women. I know that for me, it&#8217;s been poignant. I saw that my mother would never be the mother I had always hoped she would be. Instead, I see a woman who tells jokes to the nursing home staff and who talks to strangers and treats them as friends. This is a huge jump from the mother I remember who used to be a recluse and nervous around people. Now I think I see the real Janey, and I am so glad.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/parentingwithoutamanual/files/2012/05/pregnant-heart.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-279" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/parentingwithoutamanual/files/2012/05/pregnant-heart.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="288" /></a>Hi there. I am a non custodial mother. What does that mean? It means I don&#8217;t live with my kids. I don&#8217;t make their grilled cheese sandwiches. I don&#8217;t sign off on their homework. I don&#8217;t tuck them in at night. And I chose &#8212; willingly &#8212; to move 3000 miles away from them and let their dad be the primary parent-in-residence.</p>
<p>Who would do such a thing?</p>
<p>Last month I sat in a chair opposite ABC 20/20&#8217;s Elizabeth Vargas and she asked me that very question. <em>Why would a mother leave her children?</em> Elizabeth is a lovely woman. She is a mother. She fussed over flyaways in her hair before the cameras rolled. She wore a royal blue slim sheath no bigger around than a curvy pencil and charmingly commented on how skinny *I* was when we stood up after the interview. She seemed like many women I know and I liked her very much. But when she put on her Interviewer Face, I think she spoke for people who cannot fathom why a mother would stand back from her children without a gun to her head.<span id="more-278"></span></p>
<p>Sitting there opposite Elizabeth, I felt defensive. Angry. Misunderstood. I was there to defend my choice and make people understand what had happened to me: I left an emotionally abusive marriage and after struggling with joint custody for two years I moved away from my kids. And why? <em>Because I thought it was the best thing for them.</em> Period.</p>
<p>That right there should be good enough. I am my children&#8217;s mother and I looked in my heart and was shocked by what I found there &#8212; that leaving my children, who I had fought to stay near throughout a horrific custody battle that raged for two years, involved two states, and cost me over $100,000 &#8212; was the best thing for them. And for me.</p>
<p>I am still talking about this, so I must still feel something. Shame? Loss? Fear? Anger? Yep. All of those.</p>
<p>And I am not alone. There are 2.2 million mothers in the U.S. who do not live with their children. Most of them are NOT the drug addicts, alcoholics, deadbeats, and other loser types that I always thought a woman would have to be in order to be separated from her children. Most are women struggling to figure out what a mother is if she does not make the lunchtime grilled cheese sandwiches or tuck in her kids at night. Most of these women look like you and me. Most of them struggle with the same feelings I have &#8212; shame, loss, fear, and anger. Most of them, as I do,  think of their children many times a day. Most of them are amazing mothers, who recognized that their children would have a better life living apart from them than with them.</p>
<p>These mothers <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-block/the-noncustodial-mother_b_824916.html">have been described as selfless</a>.</p>
<p>Not selfish. (Elizabeth Vargas used that word in our interview. I&#8217;ve heard it before.) No, not selfish. Selfless.</p>
<p>And these mothers know that they will always be the mother. Nothing can ever take that away from them, unless they give it away.</p>
<p>Next time you walk down the street, look at the faces of the women you see. One of them might wear one of the 2.2 million faces of non custodial motherhood.</p>
<p>Some perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.brainchildmag.com/essays/spring2009_read.asp">Katy Read wrote a wonderful essay about non custodial mothers for Brain, Child</a>.</li>
<li>Spiritual leader and humanitarian <a href="http://www.sai-maa.com/en/about-sai-maa.html">Sai Maa followed her heart into spiritual work when her children were teenagers</a>, leaving her life as a mother behind.</li>
<li>Famous non custodial mothers: Shirley Maclaine, Yoko Ono, Karen Silkwood, Sinead O&#8217;Connor.</li>
<li>Famous children of non custodial mothers, who went on to have notable lives: Lady Diana, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Tina Turner.</li>
</ul>
<div>Am I still defending my choice? Maybe. I&#8217;d love to have a crystal ball and see how all this will turn out. Will my children grow up to be happier as things are today than how they might have been had I stayed and struggled? There is no way to know that. <em>There is no way to know how any of our children will grow up.</em> All we mothers can do is try to make the choices we do today for one reason &#8212; because they are the best choice we can make in the circumstances we are in. Period.</div>

<p>Hi there. I&#8217;ll bet you wanted to know this week&#8217;s Awesomest Mommy Thing, didn&#8217;t you? If <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtyqS68ViWk">this video</a> &#8212; a gorgeous weekly chronicle of baby Lotte&#8217;s evolution from birth to age 12 &#8212; doesn&#8217;t make you:</p>
<p>1) appreciate your kids even more than you did yesterday,</p>
<p>2) wish you had taken way more baby pictures,</p>
<p>then I don&#8217;t know what will. Other responses below.</p>
<p>[I tried 20 times to embed the video here. No luck. Click link and come back!]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtyqS68ViWk">Lotte, Birth To Age 12</a> &lt;&#8211;this is the video link!</p>
<p>Dear Ovaries,</p>
<p>Give it a rest. Flipping every time you see a cute baby on YouTube? Stop it. Right now.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Mother of Four.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Dear Parents Who Think Ahead,</p>
<p>I hate you. No, wait. I love you. But I hate that you have 4,388 photos of your baby, all neatly catalogued and</p>
<p>stored in fuchsia shoebox storage containers that line the top shelf of your walk-in closet (a closet the size of Rhode Island, I might add, which is reason enough for envy). Plus you can spell fuchsia without Googling it.</p>
<p>P</p>
<p>lease stop posting awesome videos of your children (videos that you have been planning for TWELVE YEARS, let&#8217;s be real here) that make the rest of us look bad. I&#8217;ll bet you never dropped your iPhone in the toilet either. And you have a clean house.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>The Rest of Us.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Father Frans Hofmeester filmed his daughter Lotte weekly for twelve years, then edited the whole thing. Lotte talks a lot. And her hair changes frequently. I adore the whole thing. You?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="float: right;margin: 4px" src="http://i233.photobucket.com/albums/ee137/lionandmagicboy/Time-Machine.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />If I had access to a time machine, you can bet I&#8217;d go back and things things differently. I&#8217;d give Mrs. Morton a piece of my mind over that bogus D on my 8th grade English paper. I wouldn&#8217;t quit my lead in my 12th grade play even though I was cast opposite a 10th grader with bad breath and looked like a Muppet. And that summer between 10th and 11th grade? I&#8217;d do something &#8212; anything, really &#8212; other than sitting by the phone waiting for a certain boy to call and playing my Best of Bread album over and over. I&#8217;d say yes more often. I&#8217;d let people help me. I&#8217;d believe in my gifts. I&#8217;d have way more fun.</p>
<p>But alas, no time machine. No TARDIS.</p>
<p>We can go back in time without a time machine. Okay, maybe not literally. But I&#8217;ve decided to write a letter to my younger self and tell her the things I think she needs to know. And then I&#8217;m going to make sure I tell my daughter every single one of these things. Just in case she didn&#8217;t already get the memo.<span id="more-275"></span></p>
<p>Dear Younger Self,</p>
<p>Take heed. The Future You (that&#8217;s me) knows what she is talking about. Pay attention and spare yourself some pain. Here&#8217;s your new to-do list.</p>
<p><strong>1. When it comes to love, don&#8217;t settle.</strong> No one should have to sift through the remains of four marriages to find this out. One day you will find your soulmate (I happen to know this for a fact). You CAN have it all when it comes to love. Hold out for what makes your heart light up like fireworks. Hold out for what makes your soul sing. Hold out for the One who encourages you, who inspires you, who thinks you are the most amazing creature he&#8217;s ever clapped his eyes upon. And who you think is the cat&#8217;s pajamas. You are so worth it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Slow down.</strong> Don&#8217;t be in a hurry. I know how badly you want to grow up. Well, stop it. This doesn&#8217;t mean living in Mom and Dad&#8217;s basement when you&#8217;re 30, but it means that it&#8217;s good to stop and dig deep under the things you think you want. Why do you want them? Buying a house at age 23 &#8212; what&#8217;s the hurry? Having babies, getting jobs, always moving on to the next thing and the next and the next? Those things will not make you happy. Smelling the metaphorical roses along the way will.</p>
<p><strong>3. It will be okay.</strong> I have spent many a night awake, worrying about things I could do nothing about, or at least, not until morning. Let it go. Worrying doesn&#8217;t help. Feeling into your pain and fear will. Getting a good&#8217;s night sleep will give you the juice you need to face life in daylight. Let it go. It will be okay.</p>
<p><strong>4. Live big. </strong>Say yes to life. Let your dreams inhabit you. You might think from where you are now that you have all the time in the world. That you can squeeze seven lifetimes into the years ahead of you. But those years will go by faster than you think. So make the most of them, all of them. Start now. Drink deeply. Breathe fully. Live big.</p>
<p>Four things. It&#8217;s a start. Good luck. I love you.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Your Future Self</p>
