		<description>well.. i guess i'm going to prove how young i am when i reply.. lol. i'm 19, and in the summer i don't have a problem wearing a spaghetti strap tank that shows my bra straps. if i'm going to work however, i make sure none of my underwear are showing. but for hanging out with my girlfriends or going to the mall (teen-friendly place) i don't have a problem letting my straps show. idk.. doesn't bother me when i see other girls bra straps either. however, panties and thongs are not to be seen!</description>

		<description>I have NO desire to see what women are wearing or not wearing under their clothes. That includes bra straps with camis/tanks.

To that end I stay tucked in. Unless the baby gets ahold of me, then it's all a crapshoot. (big tough nursing baby!)</description>

		<description>I do think this needs to stay one of ironclad Rules.

I have issues with visible undies anywhere but my own bedroom :-). They definitely have no place at work, and I don't think they have a place in public, period. I don't know most people well enough to need to see what color bra or style of panties they're wearing.</description>

		<description>I agree.  No visible undies at work.  But, in some offices in tropical countries, flipflops (especially those made by big brands) have been accepted as a casual footwear.</description>

		<description>I once wore a black bra under a white button-up top that wasn't very buttoned-up.  I wore it to a white trash party though so it probably doesn't count for much.  LOL</description>

		<description>When I lived in a very hot part of the country I occasionally wore a tank with nothing over it.  I made sure to wear a non-white/beige bra because the strap was sure to show.  

Come to think of it, I had a couple of bras that had the little adjustment clasp thingy made of brass or something -- clearly designed to be OK if seen.

Also I'll confess to having taken part in the boxers-under-ripped-jeans trend popular in the late 80s/early 90s.  And to having worn boxers (with the fly safety-pinned closed) as shorts in the late 90s.  

Never say never, say I.</description>

		<description>Well I have questions about this problem. I agree with you and I don't like when my underwear shows BUT what to do, especially in the summer when your bra strings show (because on very appropriate t-shirts or blouses, sometimes they show)? Here we can find some transparent plastic strings that are supposed to be more discrete but that plastic thing on the shoulders is not very elegant either. So what?? Any advice?</description>

		<description>i agree, but i do see a lot of girls wearing a cami solo with a bra and all the strappies are showing.  but at least in winter they toss on a sweater.  i dont understand why you would WANT someone to see your undies?  maybe it's all a push to make it 'cool' for the celebs to stop going comando?</description>

		<description>Maybe I'm too literal, but it is called *under*wear right? No one needs to see it. Camisoles aren't so much underwear these days. 

Not only should things not be sticking out, the colors should be complimentary. Don't wear your black pushup under your skin tight white sweater, even if your husband does work in the same office. Light colored pants deserve light colored undies.</description>

		<description>I have an interesting, lace-edged, see-through camisole on today, but it's under my not see through shirt. The shirt is a little more low-cut than I like and the camisole helps me feel more covered up. I'm not sure that anyone would really know it's a camisole and not just part of the shirt. Otherwise, I try very hard to never let my undergarments show. I don't think you can ever really look professional or put-together if they do.</description>
