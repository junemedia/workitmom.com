I make no secret of the fact that I&#8217;m a television junkie. It&#8217;s not the most highbrow of hobbies, granted, but I find it incredibly relaxing at the end of a long day to stare at the screen and lose myself in someone else&#8217;s story. Bonus points for entertainment that makes me laugh, but lately I&#8217;ve been watching more and more reality-based shows and realizing that my low-brow habit is actually having an unintended benefit&#8212;it&#8217;s growing my appreciation of my own job.</p>
<p>No, really. Hear me out!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been quick to extol the virtues of freelancing; there are many things about it which I love, and which I feel I couldn&#8217;t get in any other setting. But there are things about it which wear on me, too, and particularly during this year&#8212;which has been difficult for numerous reasons&#8212;I guess you could say the bloom is off the rose, a bit.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where my nightly television habit is coming in handy. <span id="more-683"></span></p>
<p>Why, there&#8217;s something to be learned in so many places about the jobs I&#8217;m <i>really, really</i> glad I&#8217;ll never have.</p>
<p><strong>Toddlers and Tiaras</strong>. I&#8217;m pretty sure that being a pageant mom is a full-time job. Also, my worst client on my very worst day was still way more manageable than a glitzed-up preschooler screaming for more Red Bull. I probably shouldn&#8217;t even admit that I ever watch this show, but I can&#8217;t help it. I don&#8217;t seek it out, but when it&#8217;s on, I have trouble turning it off. I&#8217;m <i>fascinated</i>. People live this way, spending enormous sums of money to drag their children to events, and once they&#8217;re there the moms let the kids verbally abuse them. Once the kid is on stage, the mom is out in the audience doing a pantomimed parody of whatever the kid&#8217;s supposed to be doing, and&#8230; oh, the whole thing has just made me so grateful to work in my little home office.</p>
<p><strong>American Pickers</strong>. I enjoy this show very much, but I don&#8217;t even like trying to find something I&#8217;m pretty sure should be in my son&#8217;s closet. The idea of having to pick through other people&#8217;s junk piles just to make money gives me hives. Sure, those antique porcelain signs are pretty cool, but a life on the road, getting dirty, and never knowing what you might find is definitely not for me.</p>
<p><strong>Deadliest Catch</strong>. Once upon a time this was a show that my husband watched, and somehow, eventually, I got sucked in. I don&#8217;t know how or why. But it turns out that crab fishing on the Bering Sea is kind of fascinating. <i>However</i>, I am a delicate flower who hates winter and gets seasick easily, so even though those guys make my yearly earnings in just a couple of months, no way would I want to be in their shoes. Er, boots.</p>
<p><strong>Storage Wars.</strong> Storage Wars is basically just American Pickers happening at storage facilities instead of in the backwoods of tiny towns. Pick through junk, hope to find something awesome. Too much clutter. I&#8217;m still trying to find my desk under all the crap I keep meaning to pull off of it. No thank you to purposely choosing to dig through someone <i>else</i>&#8217;s junk.</p>
<p><strong>House</strong>. Well first of all, it must be said that House had their series finale and I am terribly sad that it&#8217;s over. And second, I&#8217;m probably just really glad that I&#8217;m not a doctor. I am not cut out for life and death to hang on my decisions, I&#8217;m pretty sure. Also, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d enjoy working for a drug-addicted narcissist with no scruples. Even if I am really good at saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s not lupus. <i>It&#8217;s never lupus.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Glee</strong>. I&#8217;m eternally grateful that I&#8217;m no longer in high school, and while I have nothing but admiration and respect for those who teach our nation&#8217;s youth, no amount of money would be enough to make me spend all day, every day, with the responsibility of educating someone else&#8217;s children on my shoulders. Even if there was a lot of singing and fun costumes. (And I&#8217;m thinking that in real high schools&#8230; well, you know. More slushies-to-the-face and less show-choir-hijinks.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m telling you: a couple of hours of TV at night and suddenly any job dissatisfaction I&#8217;m experiencing magically evaporates. Because it could always be worse&#8212;I could be doing what they&#8217;re doing, instead of what I love.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/corneredoffice/files/2012/07/happy-4th.jpeg" alt="" width="200" class="alignright wp-image-682" /><br />
Tomorrow is Independence Day here in the USA, and most everyone around me&#8212;if you believe the television and radio&#8212;is getting ready to kick back at a barbecue with some frosty drinks. Independence in this country is heavily about charred meats and the right to imbibe alcohol. Oh, and there&#8217;s also the Blowing Stuff Up aspect, I guess.</p>
<p>Me, I&#8217;ve had a rough few months. My family is having a difficult year. For a while there, I didn&#8217;t know if I was even going to be able to continue working, as flexible as my freelancer&#8217;s schedule supposedly is. The idea of simply taking tomorrow off to hang out with my family feels crazy in the wake of recent life. It definitely feels like I should take the day to buckle down and catch up on work. After all, most folks will be taking the day off, so maybe I&#8217;ll finally catch up!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to do that, though. Part of what I&#8217;ve lost over the last few months is any semblance of balance in my life. Work has suffered, yes, but so has everything else. I&#8217;ve become someone who merely reacts, rather than acts. My life feels like a series of crises, and I&#8217;m just here with a fire hose turning towards the nearest fire, then the next nearest, etc.</p>
<p>In honor of the holiday (not to mention because I just can&#8217;t take it anymore), that all ends this week. <span id="more-681"></span></p>
<p>I am slowly&#8212;oh so slowly&#8212;figuring out how to keep working around everything else that needs my attention these days. I&#8217;m still working less, I&#8217;m still not convinced I&#8217;m working my <i>best</i>, but it&#8217;s a start.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to figure out how to be a person, too. Not just Crisis Mom. Not just Stressed-Out Freelancer. But a person who&#8217;s not quite so likely to drop dead of a heart attack or turn into a bitter, angry shell of the person I used to be. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been working on this week.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve scheduled an overdue doctor&#8217;s appointment, paid a stack of bills that&#8217;s been languishing on my desk, and accepted a very gracious gift from a friend and scheduled a massage for early next week.</p>
<p>I am committing myself to returning one important phone call per day. I&#8217;m far behind, so even that will take a while, but it&#8217;s a start.</p>
<p>Instead of feeling guilty about &#8220;sneaking&#8221; time on Facebook, I&#8217;ve given myself permission to get on there several times a day and am making the effort to actually interact with my friends on there a bit. (This is me taking baby steps back to rejoining society instead of just being a hermit.)</p>
<p>We had some friends over one night. It was fun!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m spending quality time with my husband and son, even if that means just a half hour here or there, in-between everything else. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m cooking and baking again. I&#8217;m eating ice cream without remorse. I&#8217;m sometimes pushing back from the computer in the middle of the day when I know I&#8217;m not being productive and going for a walk, or reading a book. Without guilt.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m rediscovering how to be a me that fits. It&#8217;s a process, and I&#8217;ve got a ways to go. But it feels good.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/corneredoffice/files/2012/06/amazon-tax.jpeg" alt="" width="200" class="alignleft wp-image-680" /><br />
One of the questions I get asked a lot is about diversifying&#8212;how, as a freelancer writer, can you fill your days and your workload with enough different kinds of gigs to make sure that a downturn in one area doesn&#8217;t wipe out your entire client base?</p>
<p>Part of this is achieved through my favorite balancing act, fun vs. profit. There are jobs that don&#8217;t pay particularly well but I really enjoy, and then there are jobs that pay gobs of money but are boring. (Most jobs fall somewhere in the middle, but I confess to always having a few gigs out on the edges, there.) Balance is the key, obviously. And of course I thought I was extra-brilliant when I started my <a href="http://wantnot.net/" target="_blank">bargain shopping website</a> because it&#8217;s a subject about which I&#8217;m passionate, but represented my entry into a new earning model: Affiliate revenue.</p>
<p>Most of the links to items I post on Want Not are affiliate links, meaning that they are tracked and I get a commission on purchases made through them. Voila, instant revenue stream! Of course, as online shopping has increased in popularity, so has the government&#8217;s desire to make sure they get their cut. And that&#8217;s how affiliate tax nexus laws began. <span id="more-679"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an oldie but a goodie, this <a href="http://performancemarketingassociation.com/advocacy/legislation/the-advertising-tax" target="_blank">summary of the laws by the Performance Marketing Association</a>, which includes the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The crux of the bills is predicated on the idea that affiliates are extension of a merchant&#8217;s sales force and thus constitute nexus for that merchant. Not only is that premise absolute wrong, it discriminates against independent small businesses and entrepreneurs using advertising model not a sales model to generate their income. Affiliates (also known as publishers) are part of an online advertising program, in which the retailers advertising partners are paid when a specific action is completed. This model is similar to traditional display advertising in print publications or broadcast media with one key difference – how payments for advertisement are determined. Based on that truth – affiliates are simply another advertising vehicle for merchants and online merchants would not have a sales presence (or nexus) in states, and should not be required to charge sales tax.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty good summation of why states started trying to tax any resident posting affiliate links on their websites. <i>It&#8217;s a short-sighted attempt to get more money.</i> As a <a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2012/04/affiliate-nexus-tax-laws.html" target="_blank">more recent piece on these laws</a> explains, though, such laws being passed in several states had the complete opposite effect&#8212;many Internet retailers simply kicked all affiliates in the affected states out of their programs, for a loss of income to those affiliates estimated to be in the 30% range, which they then were no longer paying income tax on. The end result was less money to the state, lawsuits about the constitutionality of said laws, and basically anything <i>but</i> increased state revenue.</p>
<p>These laws started appearing several years ago, and despite opposition and lawsuits, more and more states have attempted to enact similar laws. This is something I&#8217;ve kept an eye on since it began, given that I make a not-insignificant portion of my income from affiliate marketing.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s been not my greatest year in terms of keeping on top of work-related things, and so I was a little surprised when the &#8220;We&#8217;re very sorry, but we&#8217;re terminating all of our affiliates located in Georgia&#8221; emails started rolling in. What? Oh, hello <a href="http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/9412-why-georgia-affiliate-tax-is-really-no-good-news-2" target="_blank">House Bill 386 and its wake of despair</a>, let&#8217;s not pay any attention to what a miserable failure similar laws have been in New York, North Carolina, and Illinois&#8230; come on in!</p>
<p>The bad news is that I have indeed been dropped from a bunch of affiliate programs already. The good news is that years of dealing with similar laws have made some of the larger merchants (like Amazon) not quite so trigger-happy, and the fallout (so far) hasn&#8217;t been nearly as brutal as what residents of the earlier states had to deal with. My fingers are crossed that this continues to be true; time will tell.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? If you ever post, say, Amazon affiliate links, you should probably keep an eye on the legal issues surrounding these laws even if they&#8217;re not happening in your state, because your state could be next. I&#8217;ve heard stories of affiliate programs closed down in some states and people actually relocating to reopen business with them. (As a freelancer, that seems crazy to me, but if that was my <i>only</i> source of income, I guess I could see it.) As always, a good accountant can advise you if you have questions&#8230; though that wouldn&#8217;t be much help if all the affiliate programs suddenly pulled out of your state, probably.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a brave new world out there on the &#8216;net, folks. A brave new annoying and complicated world.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/corneredoffice/files/2012/06/disaster-plan-spiral.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-678" /><br />
I am practically the neurotic poster child for being ready for anything when it comes to freelancing. I&#8217;ve been writing here for <i>years</i> about all of the things you need to take into consideration before going into business for yourself&#8212;everything from handling your taxes to having redundant computer backups to making sure your work is diversified enough that one client or one particular area of expertise can&#8217;t take your business down if there&#8217;s an economic downturn.</p>
<p>I dropped out of Girl Scouts, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I ever stopped loving Being Prepared. The truth is that I am given to anxiety, and knowing what to expect&#8212;or that you&#8217;re in a position to weather even the unexpected&#8212;is the best offense against that anxiety.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s true that I have come through several disaster-level (smallish, but still) setbacks as I&#8217;ve plodded down this path, learning as I go. I&#8217;ve had the catastrophic hard drive failure without appropriate backups in place. I&#8217;ve had the IRS slap my knuckles before I turned over my finances to an accountant. I kept going even when layoffs were happening all around me (and sometimes even to me).</p>
<p>Today I want to tell you about two things emergency-prep things; one, I did just right. The other, I got all wrong. <span id="more-677"></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with what I did right: Even during periods of relative financial prosperity, I continued to live and behave as though we were one paycheck away from being destitute. That&#8217;s my own particular bogeyman, I know, but I see advice <i>all the time</i> exhorting freelancers to not get too excited by the big checks, and I still know lots of people who don&#8217;t seem to understand that today&#8217;s windfall often precedes tomorrow&#8217;s missing payments.</p>
<p>I am naturally frugal, so this wasn&#8217;t particularly hard for me. (And I mean that in the sense that <i>of course</i> I would love to spend more money, but I am more comfortable with money in the bank than with large expenditures.) I understand that it&#8217;s probably harder for folks who aren&#8217;t given to internally catastrophizing the way that I am. (Heh.) And when I was saving up that money, I was thinking &#8220;just in case all the work dries up&#8221; or &#8220;what if the air conditioning dies.&#8221; I was most certainly <i>not</i> thinking &#8220;What if my child has a unforeseen medical condition for which our insurance eventually decides they will no longer provide coverage?&#8221;</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m here to tell you that if nothing else has convinced you to sock away more money in savings than you&#8217;re currently managing, feel free to think about that one for a little bit. Because right now my child is in the hospital her doctors told us she needs to be at, and our health insurance said, &#8220;Yeah, no. We don&#8217;t think we need to pay for that.&#8221; And wouldn&#8217;t you know it, I think the hospital we&#8217;re at hears that a lot, so they asked us for a deposit on her care. They asked us for a <i>substantial</i> deposit on her care.</p>
<p>And we paid it. Of course. What other choice did we have?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been neurotic about saving money for years and years. I&#8217;ve been relentlessly teased by my family, my husband, and sometimes even friends about it. No one is teasing me now! </p>
<p>[Sidebar: Writing about the horror and suckage of this situation---having a gravely ill child, that is---could fill tomes. My point here is only about the money, and while this unexpected financial burden is horrifying, it should go without saying that this is the <i>least</i> horrifying thing about our current situation. Thank God.]</p>
<p>So: I did the saving money thing right. Assuming we have chosen wisely in changing my daughter&#8217;s care, the hope is that she will get well before we go bankrupt. Um. Yay?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I did wrong: In all of my planning and what-if-ing and Being Prepared for any situation, I never figured out what I would do if I couldn&#8217;t keep working, or if I had to work a lot less. Right now, I&#8217;m working way less. Yes, my laptop can go with me anywhere, but right now it&#8217;s spending most of its time closed. I&#8217;ve lost clients. Even the understanding ones aren&#8217;t paying me for not working (they&#8217;re just allowing me off the hook for some things, and then I don&#8217;t get paid), and I&#8217;m sure as heck not accumulating new clients, or maintaining my previous reputation for reliability.</p>
<p>(That was really hard to type. I used to take a lot of pride in trumping the &#8220;unreliable freelancer&#8221; stereotype. Right now I&#8217;m not very reliable. Not a lot of pride happening over here lately.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that I never figured out how to handle a circumstance like this. I never took the time to work out which gigs I would need to let slide and which I had to keep up with. I never really worked through what my alternatives would be&#8212;who would I trust to guest-write for me? who might be able to take over on specific jobs, if needed?&#8212;and now that I&#8217;m in the thick of crisis, I honestly can&#8217;t think straight enough to make good decisions.</p>
<p>I should&#8217;ve thought about this before, before I needed it. Maybe I never would&#8217;ve needed it, but now that I <i>do</i>, you can bet I wish I had.</p>
<p>Right now, when you finish reading this, put two things on your to-do list:<br />
1) Rethink how much money can go directly into your emergency fund savings,<br />
and<br />
2) Start working on a work coverage plan that gives you some options if you run into a situation where your work hours are limited.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>

We&#8217;ve all heard the horror stories about clients who don&#8217;t pay, of course. I&#8217;ve shaken my head more times than I count, as fellow freelancers recount for me how this client or that one owes them thousands of dollars for completed work.</p>
<p>I have a confession to make: I&#8217;ve always felt&#8230; well, a little <i>smug</i> listening to those stories. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s ever okay for a client not to pay up as directed by their contractual obligation, you understand, but in listening to more than one story I thought to myself, &#8220;How on <i>earth</i> did she continue working for them without getting paid? Why didn&#8217;t she just say, &#8216;Until payment is current, I need to cease work on this project.&#8217;??&#8221; Non-payment&#8212;I thought&#8212;was quite possibly a result of a freelancer who wasn&#8217;t professional enough, assertive enough to push for payment in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Naturally that was practically an engraved invitation for karma to come bite me on the ass. I should&#8217;ve known better. <span id="more-675"></span></p>
<p>In seven+ years of freelancing, I&#8217;ve only gotten burned on payment twice. I think that&#8217;s a pretty good record, so I can&#8217;t complain too much. Moreover, neither situation has left me looking for huge chunks of money, either, so if I never got paid, <i>financially</i> it&#8217;s not a huge deal. A quick perusal of <a href="http://worldslongestinvoice.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">The World&#8217;s Longest Invoice</a> reassures me that I am still small potatoes in this arena. Heh.</p>
<p>The first situation happened a couple of years ago, and involved a client just like the ones you can so often find on <a href="http://clientsfromhell.net/" target="_blank">Clients From Hell</a>. It was a <i>Really Big Project</i> and was going to lead to <i>Really Big Things</i>, all of which seemed to require hours upon hours of phone calls and emails before there was even a contract. And then the client was very specific about the work required, and finally I turned in an actual assignment&#8230; which they <i>hated</i>. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m infallible, or anything, but that&#8217;s never happened to me before. I did what I was told to do and then ripped apart for not doing what they <i>wanted</i>. Apparently this job required omniscience; it was suddenly all clear. I backed out of the contract as gracefully as I could manage, explaining that I didn&#8217;t think I was really the person they needed. Payment for the work completed was promised, and I made a mental note not to hold my breath.</p>
<p>Good thing, too&#8212;they never did pay me. I didn&#8217;t pursue it, either, because the stench of Utter Crazy on that entire project made me just happy to have escaped.</p>
<p>Today, however, I had to send an email that quite literally made me a little sweaty. Let&#8217;s be clear: the amount of money owed to me is in the hundreds of dollars, not thousands. It&#8217;s not going to make or break me. <i>However</i>, I did the work requested, I did it on time, and I did it well. It was published; it was actually published in a major magazine, one which I know could easily pay my bill using money from their petty cash drawer. (Do companies have petty cash drawers anymore?) It is not the case that the people involved are crazy or scattered, or that the company is broke.</p>
<p>They simply haven&#8217;t paid me. I submitted the work in December, and it&#8217;s now June. And I still haven&#8217;t been paid.</p>
<p>For a while, the editor who hired me sent back the obligatory &#8220;Oh my gosh, I&#8217;m so sorry, let me look into that for you,&#8221; emails. We would go back and forth, and then&#8230; radio silence.</p>
<p>Ordinarily I would stay on top of something like this with a vengeance, but I&#8217;ve had kind of a crappy year and a lot of distractions. (When my kid was in the hospital, I wasn&#8217;t doing invoice battle with anyone, for example.) So maybe it&#8217;s gone longer than it should because I kept just walking away from it.</p>
<p>Still, the last three emails went unanswered.</p>
<p>So today I sent one more email, and I copied it up the food chain to The Powers That Be, and I made it clear that in two weeks I will seek legal action pursuant to their non-payment, if I have to.</p>
<p>Said legal action would undoubtedly cost me more than what they owe me. It might be a stupid thing to do.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I&#8217;m just the stupid sort of person who would do it, anyway, because I can&#8217;t shake the feeling that the big magazine is probably just disorganized, sure, but also maybe they figure the little guy will eventually just give up and walk away in disgust. I&#8217;m the sort of stupid person who would rather make a stink, make things difficult for them, and yes, make sure that <i>all</i> of my freelancing cohorts know exactly which magazine thinks it&#8217;s okay to stiff their freelancers, than walk away and not lose even more money.</p>
<p>But honestly, I hope I don&#8217;t have to do that. I hope they just pay the damn bill.</p>

Back in the early days of blogging (you know, when dinosaurs roamed the earth) (kidding; more like about a decade ago), there was this constant conversation about audience and boundaries. Personal blogging was a new beast; no one knew for sure how much it was okay to share. Some advocated total honesty, others feared some sort of mysterious backlash that could only come of reckless secret-telling.</p>
<p>I sort of feel like we&#8217;ve come full circle. That conversation was a constant, for a while, and then it kind of petered out as people blogged about things other than their personal lives&#8212;and those who did blog about their lives figured out how to set workable boundaries&#8212;and now I see it coming up again in different ways.</p>
<p>A few months ago when BlogHer was soliciting panel proposals, I was approached about being a panel about blogging about your special needs kid&#8217;s school. Our panel was not selected, unfortunately, which is a shame because I think it would&#8217;ve been really interesting. More and more you hear about unintended repercussions particularly among those of us in the IEP/special education trenches, and I was eager to hear others&#8217; stories on the topic. Of course, at the time, no one at my son&#8217;s school was reading my blog, so it was kind of theoretical for me. <span id="more-673"></span></p>
<p>About a week before school finished up, this year, I got a very sweet email from one of my son&#8217;s teachers about something he&#8217;d done in class. &#8220;And by the way,&#8221; the email concluded, &#8220;I spent most of the weekend reading your blog!&#8221; I <i>died</i> when I read those words. Even though I have Rules. (I am all about rules.) Thankfully, the next sentence went on to say how much she enjoyed it and how funny I am (phew!), but still, there&#8217;s that pang of fear when I realize someone I know in person is reading me&#8230; and that pang multiplies by about a hundredfold when it&#8217;s someone who&#8217;s so important to my family.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about this topic, again.</p>
<p>Just about five years ago now <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/corneredoffice/2008/05/08/the-price-of-fame-is-uh-fame/" target="_blank">I had my 5 minutes of fame on The Today Show</a>, and two of the things I said during that interview (I don&#8217;t think either of them made it into the final edit, incidentally) were essentially the tenets of my blogging existence. They were:<br />
1) Never blog anything you wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable telling as a story at a cocktail party,<br />
and<br />
2) My blog is a love letter to my children.</p>
<p>Even back then, I did not believe in blogging like no one is reading. If you want to write like no one&#8217;s reading you, <i>write in a diary</i> and maybe <i>don&#8217;t let anyone read it</i>. Words have consequences, and when you choose to let them loose in the world, I think it merits some thought about what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish and what you&#8217;re willing to possibly endure as a result.</p>
<p>On the other hand, personal bloggers who never get personal are usually boring. What is safe is often uninteresting.</p>
<p>So the trick is to find your own personal line between boring and dangerous, and then walk it like it&#8217;s the tightrope to Nirvana, I guess.</p>
<p>But the thing is, I used to feel like that line was pretty clear. For years and years, I wrote about my life online, secure in what I revealed and what I held back, and it made sense to me. This year, that all kind of unravelled. Ever since my teenager&#8217;s been sick I&#8217;ve just felt&#8230; stilted. That sharp line that I&#8217;ve adhered to for years has gone blurry.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m no longer writing a love letter to my kids, it&#8217;s that one of my kids is in so much pain that I am afraid of making it worse. Now, or later. I don&#8217;t know what she needs and I can&#8217;t bear to think I might make her already difficult life even harder. Her story is her own, of course, though so much of mine is tangled up in hers.</p>
<p>So now, I blog like&#8230; a person who isn&#8217;t sure what it&#8217;s okay to say. And that&#8217;s probably not the most entertaining reading.</p>
<p>But the point of <i>this</i> post is that it made me realize: The real rule in blogging is to blog like the people who matter most to you are reading. Whatever that means.</p>

I&#8217;ve written before about the challenges that face any freelancer who attempts to take a vacation; unlike those who work salaried jobs, freelancers can (theoretically) take vacation whenever they want. The problem, of course, is that salaried positions limit vacation time, but then you are (usually) not expected to do any work while exercising said vacation days. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want, and if I have my computer, I can work.</p>
<p>The problem is that it&#8217;s very hard not to do that. It&#8217;s very rare for me to stop working entirely even while &#8220;on vacation,&#8221; and most of my fellow freelancers suffer from the same malady. All work and no play may make Jack a dull boy, but if Jack was a freelancer writer I suspect all work and no play would make Jack a burned out, bitter person. Just a guess.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken several different approaches to various vacations over the years, from killing myself for up to a month beforehand to get work done ahead of time (stressful!) to just telling clients I will be unavailable and giving up income for some time period (also stressful!). This time, I&#8217;m winging it. <span id="more-671"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to tell you I&#8217;ve found the perfect balance, and it&#8217;s born of experience and wisdom. I would. That would be a lie, unfortunately. The truth is that I&#8217;m on a family vacation and the stress of life in general lately meant that 1) I was already working less than usual before we left and 2) I didn&#8217;t really have the presence of mind to <i>plan</i> how I was going to handle work while we&#8217;re here. So for better or for worse (little humor for you there&#8212;part of the impetus for this trip was to attend a wedding), here&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve kind of been handling it.</p>
<p><strong>Turn stress into an advantage.</strong> I live in the Eastern time zone, and we&#8217;re currently on Pacific time. Every night I am trying to stay awake past the time when everyone&#8217;s kids go to bed, and then silently cursing when I wake up hours before anyone else. Am I tired? Oh God yes; I&#8217;m exhausted. But until I adjust to the time change, I can use those early morning hours to work, without missing out on any family time later on.</p>
<p><strong>If you have to work, make it work.</strong> I know some people can&#8217;t work with any sort of distractions going on, but I do pretty well in a noisy room if I have to. So rather than holing up in my room to do work during the day when I must, I sit down in the middle of the chaos with my laptop. That way I&#8217;m not missing as much, and I still get to enjoy being surrounded by the extended family I&#8217;m here to visit!</p>
<p><strong>Let some stuff go, even if you don&#8217;t have a firm plan.</strong> If I was smart (or less stressed out and more organized before we left), I would&#8217;ve come up with a plan for the work I planned to continue and the work I was okay skipping this week. I didn&#8217;t manage to do that. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s not impossible to prioritize on the fly&#8212;some work is continuing as usual, some isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s only a week and the sky won&#8217;t fall if I don&#8217;t do everything.</p>
<p><strong>Accept that some days nothing will get done.</strong> It&#8217;s a vacation, after all. The day we went to the Grand Canyon was a long day and not exactly amenable to spending quality time with my laptop. So I didn&#8217;t. I made sure to maximize my time the next morning, but it all seemed to work out.</p>
<p><strong>When not working, ditch the guilt.</strong> It&#8217;s not enough to make peace with it being a day (or an hour) where you&#8217;re not working. Embrace the change in routine and remember that as long as it&#8217;s not work time, you may as well not waste any time feeling guilty or wishing that it was. I don&#8217;t even attempt a vacation very often; how ridiculous would it be for me to spend it wishing I was working?</p>
<p><strong>Remember it&#8217;s temporary.</strong> For me, it&#8217;s just a week. There&#8217;s very little I could do to make or break my career in a single week, right? Right.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll be back in a week, and it&#8217;ll be okay.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/corneredoffice/files/2012/05/fail_stamp.jpeg" alt="" width="172" height="107" class="alignright size-full wp-image-669" /><br />
You would think there would come a time when seriously misguided PR outreach would stop happening, but you would be wrong. It&#8217;s the gift that keeps on giving! No sooner does one crop of so-called professionals figure out that they&#8217;re being rightfully taunted, then another group steps in to take their place. It&#8217;s the circle of life, or something.</p>
<p>This is our cross to bear, as freelancers. There is always someone out there who figures we are just <i>dying</i> to work for them for free. I mean, that&#8217;s how you make a living, right? Giving away your hard work for the heck of it?</p>
<p>&#8230; no?</p>
<p>Honestly, most of the time I get this sort of &#8220;pitch&#8221; these days, I just delete the email. It takes time and energy to explain, over and over, why it&#8217;s insulting and ridiculous to be asked to work for no pay. So most of the time, I just let it go. For some reason, today I took the bait. <span id="more-670"></span></p>
<p>The weird thing is that the pitch came in because of <i>this</i> site, Cornered Office&#8212;a place where it should be noted that I am paid per post to produce content. Huh.</p>
<p>The original email came from&#8230; well, let&#8217;s call this person Frick. And the email was copied to a colleague, whom we&#8217;ll call Frack. Both of these professionals have email addresses indicating they&#8217;re employed by a sizable PR firm. Some details have been changed, but here&#8217;s (more or less) the first email:</p>
<blockquote><p><i><strong>Subject: New Opportunity for Cornered Office</strong></p>
<p>Hello Mir,</p>
<p>We work with SuperShinyNewSite.com – a new, fast-growing web portal that provides news, financial, job search and shopping services to visitors so it can give back to charities. The recently launched site already has tens of thousands of visitors a day and it’s poised to grow exponentially.</p>
<p>We’re recruiting a select group of bloggers to contribute to SuperShinyNewSite.com. We would like you to integrate your blog into the site. Coverage on parenting and working from home would be an essential element to the site.</p>
<p>The benefits for you could include:</p>
<p>Added national exposure for your blog<br />
Strengthening your position as a thought leader in parenting and working from home<br />
Unmatched growth potential</p>
<p>SuperShinyNewSite, the company behind the development of the site, is committed to putting the resources and effort behind making SuperShinyNewSite.com a success. The project already has had significant measurable growth since its start a little more than a year ago.  </p>
<p>We’re open to suggestions and would consider regular blog contributions focusing on women in business, work/life issues and tips.</p>
<p>Visit the site. Look around and tell us what you think. Let us know if you would like to join SuperShinyNewSite.com in this exciting new venture.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions. We look forward to further discussing a potential partnership.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Frick</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Man. That&#8217;s an awful lot of words to say &#8220;we want your content for free,&#8221; but for whatever reason I went ahead and took a look at the Alexa site metrics for SuperShinyNewSite.com. They were abysmal compared to both this site and the blogs I myself own. So the whole &#8220;great exposure&#8221; thing was&#8230; a stretch, at best. But what about the charity angle? Maybe offering up your work when it&#8217;s <i>for charity</i> is a good idea! I poked around on SuperShinyNewSite and discovered that&#8230; 10% of their revenue goes to charity. Um. 10% of my revenue goes to charity, too, but I don&#8217;t advertise myself as working so that I can give back to charities.</p>
<p>In short, I smelled a rat.</p>
<p>I emailed Frick back, making sure to copy Frack as well (as the original email had):</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Hi Frick,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t work for free. Even if I was willing to work for &#8220;exposure&#8221; at this point in my career, a quick check of traffic statistics reveals that Cornered Office (for which I am paid a reasonable freelancer&#8217;s rate) and my personal blogs all have exponentially greater readership than SuperShinyNewSite.com.</p>
<p>Best of luck finding contributors.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Mir</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect a response. But I got two: One from Frick, thanking me for my response (thumbs up for being appropriate and professional), as well as the following from Frack:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Hello Mir,<br />
I work with Frick on the SuperShinyNewSite blogger initiative, and wanted to jump in to provide some added context for you. For now, it is correct that SuperShinyNewSite is not providing monetary compensation. But as the site grows, the opportunity for that will change.<br />
We can provide you with the Double Click report that shows about 1 million page views in the 1st Quarter. That jumped from about 50,000 the previous quarter.<br />
Yes, the site is new. But the principals behind have brought us on board to conduct a media campaign, and start their social media initiatives. They’re investing heavily in SEO and will soon start a full-blown marketing campaign. In short, they have the resources to do everything that’s needed to grow the site, and quickly.<br />
They would be happy to have a Cornered Office presence on the site. Would you be willing to have two <strong>original</strong> blog contributions on the site a month to start? To see if it works for you?<br />
 Each post would include a brief bio, and, of course, a link back to your site of choice.<br />
Please feel free to call me if you have any more questions? I’m sure there’s a way that we can work together to find a mutually beneficially arrangement.<br />
 We look forward to your feedback.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Frack needs some lessons in reading comprehension. And also for someone to demonstrate how one leaves spaces between paragraphs. But given everything that had so far transpired, I sent one last email:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Frack, I wonder if you read the entire email (it wasn&#8217;t that long) I sent to Frick. I don&#8217;t work for free. Most of the time in life, and certainly in freelancing, you get what you pay for. Will you be able to find folks to write for you for free? Undoubtedly. Will they produce the kind of quality content you&#8217;d get from a professional writer with years of experience (such as myself)? No. That&#8217;s obviously a choice your client is free to make.</p>
<p>Sure, I&#8217;d be willing to produce two original posts per month for you&#8230; let&#8217;s say $250/post. With the site growing as quickly as you say, that shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. If that&#8217;s of interest, I&#8217;d be happy to draw up a contract. If you&#8217;re continuing to fish for free content after I&#8217;ve explicitly clarified that I don&#8217;t work for free, please stop wasting my time (and yours).</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I haven&#8217;t heard back. Huh.</p>

(<em>Pictured here: Much happier teens than the ones currently living with me. Clearly they&#8217;re actors.</em>)</p>
<p>When my children were preschoolers/young elementary age, I remember thinking that I would give any amount of money to have ten&#8212;heck, <i>five</i>&#8212;uninterrupted minutes to myself while they were awake. Little kids are a lot of work. They&#8217;re demanding; they need you constantly. They can&#8217;t make their own food, they need help with dressing, bathing, packing up for school, doing homework, just about everything. They need close supervision so that they don&#8217;t attempt to &#8220;fly&#8221; off the kitchen counter (my son) or flush random objects down the toilet &#8220;just because&#8221; (my daughter).</p>
<p>Little kids are exhausting.</p>
<p>Working from home and parenting little kids is an exercise in constant frustration. When I first started freelancing, I never worked while the kids were home and awake. It just wasn&#8217;t possible. I did some work while they were at school, then finished after they went to bed. That was just the only way to make it happen. <span id="more-667"></span></p>
<p>I yearned for the day when I could respond to &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry&#8221; with &#8220;then you should have something to eat.&#8221; I could scarcely picture a world in which both of my children could&#8230; I don&#8217;t know&#8230; shower independently, get into their jammies, heck, even put themselves to bed if necessary. It seemed like all I needed was for them to gain some independence, and then <i>my</i> independence would be significantly increased. And we would all live happily ever after!</p>
<p>Allow me to make my most significant comment on that fantasy right here: HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA. Yeah. No.</p>
<p>I remember that people used to say to me, &#8220;Little kids, little problems. Big kids, big problems.&#8221; And I would smile and nod while thinking to myself, &#8220;Clearly this person has forgotten what a bedwetting, night-terror-experiencing child does to your sleep schedule <i>and your soul</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, karma. I&#8217;m sorry I doubted.</p>
<p>The truth is that I can now sleep through the night almost all the time. That did get better. Also, it&#8217;s fantastic that my children can not only make their own sandwiches, but will occasionally fix dinner for the family if I ask. They do homework independently (though they&#8217;ll ask me to check it for them, after) and I never have to come be a mystery reader in their classrooms. (Though, truth be told, I kind of miss doing that.) They can do their own laundry and no one needs a change of clothing packed in their backpacks for school. School&#8217;s nearly out for summer, and I neither have to book the kids solid in camps nor deal with &#8220;Moooooom, I&#8217;m booooooored&#8221; if I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s absolutely true that my older children are more independent, and that means I, in turn, have greater freedom in my work scheduling.</p>
<p><em>But</em>. Little kids, little problems. You know, if your little kid is hungry, you make him a sandwich. It takes some time, but it&#8217;s an easily solved problem. Big kids, big problems: What&#8217;s the solution to your daughter being sexually harassed at school? It&#8217;s not as clearcut as making a sandwich, that&#8217;s for sure. It takes a lot more time and the outcome isn&#8217;t nearly as straightforward. Go ahead, ask me how I know this.</p>
<p>I would rather go back to doing all the laundry than deal with shopping for clothes with one kid who is style- and brand-conscious and another who&#8217;s currently in a growth spurt that means everything I buy today will be outgrown quite literally by next month.</p>
<p>I would rather go back to feeling like &#8220;I can&#8217;t work while the kids are awake&#8221; than deal with the guilt of working while they&#8217;re here, sometimes, only to lose entire days to school meetings, shuffling them to things like physical therapy, or having to check the computer logs to see what, exactly, the kids were doing while I finished up that one late assignment.</p>
<p>I would rather go back to being woken up multiple times a night by a child who is easily comforted by my arms and my voice, than to count up the nights I&#8217;ve lain awake, mired in worry, only to be screamed at or otherwise disrespected by the wonder that is the hurting teen, a.k.a. The Most Self-Centered Creature On Earth.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t misunderstand me; I wouldn&#8217;t wish away my kids&#8217; growth, even if I could. Difficulties and all, it&#8217;s fascinating and awesome to watch them turn into full-grown people. I see glimpses of the adults they&#8217;ll soon become and it gives me hope. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s easier to parent little kids, either; no matter the phase of development, parenting is exhausting. All I&#8217;m saying is that anyone who thinks teenagers need less time from their parents have clearly never raised any.</p>

The harsh realities of my life right now are&#8230; less than ideal. I am still struggling with a continuing kid health crisis on the home front, and <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/corneredoffice/2012/03/06/putting-my-time-and-money-where-my-mouth-is/" target="_blank">the havoc that&#8217;s wreaking on my career</a>. Things get better, I start trying to get back to working more, then things get worse and I work even less, etc. [Pro tip: I find that I simply cannot recommend chronic illness as a "growing experience." I'd rather we have a little less personal growth and a little more feeling like life is manageable, thanks.]</p>
<p>Professionally, I am scaling back on everything (again!) and begging for mercy from my clients (again!) and feeling very much like a failure because I can&#8217;t seem to find my equilibrium. Personally, i am worried sick (literally, though my health issues are paltry compared to what my kid is facing), exhausted, and feeling like a terrible mother because I can&#8217;t fix this. And yes, logically, I know it&#8217;s not for me to fix. Emotionally&#8212;particularly when, say, my child is crying &#8220;FIX IT!&#8221;&#8212;I feel like&#8230; a failure. (Do you see a pattern emerging, here?)</p>
<p>So rather than focusing on the (rotten) reality, I thought a bit of fantasy would be more fun. <span id="more-665"></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s play the &#8220;what if you won the lottery&#8221; game!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really care what you would buy or the trips you would take or whatever. I don&#8217;t care how you&#8217;d spend the money; that&#8217;s not the point. To me, the question is this: If money was no object, would you still work?</p>
<p>This is an endlessly fascinating subject to me, because when I talk about this with people (don&#8217;t ask me how often I talk about this with folks; it seems to come up now and again, enough that I&#8217;ve had more than one conversation about it with multiple folks), there&#8217;s always someone who says, &#8220;Oh, I could never stop working. I&#8217;d be bored.&#8221;</p>
<p>That response always makes me wonder if the respondent needs more hobbies.</p>
<p>To me, it&#8217;s not a binary state, i.e., you work or you sit around and stare at the walls. It&#8217;s not even you work or you do absolutely nothing of value. While I love my work, I also love&#8230; reading. Petting my dog. Going for walks. Swimming. Sleeping in. Spending time with my children. I always laugh when someone says they could never stop working even if they didn&#8217;t need the money. Me? I could stop working. <i>Not a problem</i>, thanks. Maybe that means I&#8217;m lazy, but I prefer to believe it means 1) I need a vacation and 2) I have a lot of other interests. Heh.</p>
<p>Would I stop writing? Of course not. I love writing. But would I stop doing it for money? Maybe. Maybe I&#8217;d work on a novel instead of taking freelance gigs.</p>
<p>Right now, if money was no object, I think I would tend to my children&#8217;s needs, find a way to tend to my own needs (more sleep, less stress), and I would turn my back on work until the current crisis passes. As it is, my income is down quite a bit. But I can&#8217;t afford to just stop working, so I continue sort of limping along even on the days when I&#8217;ve had two hours of sleep and four doctors&#8217; appointments to get the patient to.</p>
<p>So would <strong>I</strong> stop working if I won the lottery? In a heartbeat. I love what I do, yes. And my life is&#8230; overfull, shall we say, right now. But the bottom line is yes.</p>
<p>Are you one of those &#8220;Oh no, I could never give it up&#8221; kinds of people? If so, do we &#8220;heck yes I&#8217;d quit&#8221; folks sound lazy to you? I&#8217;m curious, as I&#8217;m either alone on this or I&#8217;m truly a slacker.</p>
