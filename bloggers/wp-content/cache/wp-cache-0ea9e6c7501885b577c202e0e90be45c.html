		<description>I have a parenting mentor -- my aunt, who's only a few years older than me and has four children. Amazing woman.

I had a mentor when I was starting my childcare business, and she saved me so much grief! I don't have one for the career switch I'm making, nor for the career I want to be in, and so I feel I'm floundering a bit,  not moving forward efficiently to my goals, because I don't know enough about it all. ARGH. I have had some help along the way, for which I am exceedingly grateful, but I need more. Diligently seeking mentors...</description>

		<description>Daisy - I admire you.  I think I would be a stressed out wench if I had to learn a new job AND mentor.  That said I think you should definitely look for a mentor for yourself.  Mentors can have mentors you know!  :)</description>

		<description>I'm in the unenviable position of being a mentor and learning a new position at the same time. It's tough. I could use a mentor, or at least a sounding board, myself.</description>

		<description>Kate - first of all - you crack me up.  Your excitement is awesome!  Second, I think there is nothing wrong with what I call Reverse Mentoring - the art of learning from the idiocy and mistakes of others.  LOL</description>

		<description>ok must buy the book.  i dont really have many business mentors.  i am just sort of floundering around.  is it bad that i look around and really dont see anyone i would want to emulate?  i figure, just keep looking at the 'lessons of what NOT to do!'

Though actually, my current boss is pretty fantastic.  maybe i am just not a good mentoree LOL</description>
