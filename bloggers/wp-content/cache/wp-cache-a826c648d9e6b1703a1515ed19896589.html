		<description>I make this on a regular basis. I use a red curry and I use more like 3 tbl sp of it.  This is one of my favorite meals of all time. And I kind of consider myself a foodie. Try it! It's that fabulous!</description>

		<description>I just made some for dinner and my family just LOVED it, especially my 8 month old. We used butternut squash and eggplant in place of the sweet potatoes. The orange juice really does the trick. Thank you for the recipe :)</description>

		<description>What about using the lighter sweet potatoe, not the reddish ones, but the lighter yellower ones?</description>

		<description>I don't get this statement in the recipe..

Each can or coconut milk yields approx 2 cups of milk. I used 3 cups of rice to 4 cups of coconut milk to 2 cups of water ratio.

3 cups of rice to 4 cups of coconut milk?

Why did you confuse it by adding 2 cups of water ratio?  Do you mean instead of using 2 cups of water, use 4 cups of coconut milk?

Thank you.</description>

		<description>I hesitated to comment because this post is almost 3 years old. But, I can't resist. I made this. And it was so good. Then I shared it on facebook, because how could I keep this to myself? And then my friends made it for their families and friends. And they shared it on facebook.
Thank you for making this. I'm actually considering doing a year-long slow cooker challenge . . . if I follow through (which I'm kind of bad about doing, check my blog for more on that), this recipe will be a part of the menu.
Anyway - thanks again. This recipe is being used in households from New York, to Ohio, to Kansas. And people are lovin' it.
I found your blog via your roasted potato love post (which had me in stitches, btw). The more I read, the more I love.</description>

		<description>This was great.  I only used a pound of chicken and 1 sweet potato since it was just for my husband and I, although I did use about a cup of orange juice -- I loved the citrusy zing it added.  I also used garam masala, an Indian spice blend, instead of regular yellow curry powder, which I think gave it a wonderful depth of flavor.  Will definitely be making this again and will experiment with different kinds of meats and veggies to add to it.  Thanks for the recipe!</description>

		<description>@ Suzanne:
You can either copy and paste the recipe into Microsoft Word, or any other word processing program, and delete the pictures there. 
Or you can use this handy tool:
http://css-tricks.com/examples/ThePrintliminator/
It works very nicely, you can remove the pictures directly from the web page before printing it.  Watch the video in the link above.</description>

		<description>I asked my boyfriend to make this.  The directions and pictures made it look easy.  My boyfriend isn't big on cooking, but I thought he could handle it.

First off, he loves onions, so he used three.  He wasn't sure what a clove of garlic was, he actually thought it was a head.  He was going to add the entire head of garlic, but then got tired after chopping three cloves and stopped there (thank you Lord).  
He also doesn't like chopping things, but loves using fancy gadgets.  So he used the MANdoline to slice the onions and sweet potatoes into thin slivers.

I came home and the house smelled wonderful.  I stirred the crockpot and noticed that it was starting to stick, so I added lots of chicken broth to it.  By the time it was finished cooking, the broth wasn't fully absorbed, but that's ok.

The bottom line ... if you play around with this recipe, it'll still taste FANTASTIC!

Thank you for a wonderful recipe.</description>
