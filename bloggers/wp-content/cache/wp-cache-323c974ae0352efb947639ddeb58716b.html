			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was talking about princesses with my 7-year-old daughter the other day, and the discussion turned to the idea of princesses who need to be rescued (Cinderella, for example, or Sleeping Beauty) and princesses who don&#8217;t (Disney&#8217;s revamped Rapunzel, and Merida, the red-headed heroine of the newest Disney/Pixar movie, &#8220;Brave.&#8221;) As an example of Princesses who do the rescuing, I brought up Eowyn from &#8220;Return of the King,&#8221; the last book in the &#8220;Lord of the Ring&#8221; trilogy.</p>
<p>(You know, Eowyn&#8230; the princess who defied her father and rode into battle to defeat the embodiment of evil, who could not be killed by any man. &#8220;I am no man,&#8221; she declared as slayed the faceless demon.)</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; I told her, &#8220;next time someone says you can&#8217;t do something just because you&#8217;re a girl&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom,&#8221; she interrupted, rolling her eyes a tiny bit. &#8220;No one has <em>ever</em> told me that.&#8221; <span id="more-728"></span></p>
<p>When I was her age, rarely heard it, and when I did it was a.) from a kid my own age, and b.) had nothing to do with anything important &#8212; fort-building and secret clubs, not career options or education. Growing up in India in the 1950s, my mom heard frequently and she mostly ignored it, leaving home to study abroad even though she was the daughter and not the son. Her mother, my grandmother, heard it nearly constantly, and defied people as readily as Disney&#8217;s Merida, becoming a member of Parliament.</p>
<p>But my daughter? No one has <em>ever</em> told her that she couldn&#8217;t do something just because she&#8217;s a girl, she says. And that makes me feel incredibly hopeful for her future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday">The 36-Hour Day</a> for <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2007/11/05/sometimes-it-takes-a-36-hour-day/">a little more than four years</a> now. That&#8217;s a little more than 340 posts about juggling career and  family, working outside the home and inside the home, and trying to  figure out an honest answer to the perennial question: &#8220;How do you do it?&#8221; &#8212; which, depending on the speaker and the context, sometimes sounds a lot more like <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2009/11/12/i-am-not-your-little-lady/" target="_blank">&#8220;You can&#8217;t do that, you&#8217;re a girl.&#8221;</a> Or, more often, <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2008/07/31/shrapnel-from-anothe-mommy-drive-by/" target="_blank">&#8220;You can&#8217;t do that, you&#8217;re a <em>mom</em>.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Our course we can do &#8220;that&#8221; &#8212; whatever &#8220;that&#8221; may be. Having <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2010/11/08/my-most-important-network-other-working-parents/" target="_blank">an amazing network</a> of like-minded people helps tremendously; having <a href="http://www.workitmom.com">great resources </a>makes a difference. <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2011/05/26/on-things-lost-and-found/" target="_blank">Little changes and triumphs</a> can help you go from <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2011/03/17/is-telecommuting-a-perk-or-a-necessity-2/" target="_blank">a job that pays the bills</a> to one that <a href="http://writeeditrepeat.blogspot.com/2011/11/exclusive-interview-with-michelle-obama.html" target="_blank">fits in with your dreams</a>.</p>
<p>But the funny thing about <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2010/11/24/is-gratitude-relative/" target="_blank">landing your dream job</a> is that it can involve having to say goodbye to some of the wonderful things that helped you land it in the first place. And, for me, that includes this column.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and sharing your stories with me for these last four years. I&#8217;m looking forward to continue reading about all of the fabulous things we working moms do when we ignore the &#8220;you can&#8217;t&#8221; comments and explore the things we <em>can</em> do.</p>

I love finding out new ways to use the things I have lying around the house and easy ways to get more life out of the things I already have.</p>
<p>Did you know you could use a plastic drinking straw to hull strawberries? (Just push it through the bottom and out the top &#8212; the green part your kids hate will pop off.) I tried the trick for keeping a cut apple from browning this morning when I packed my daugher&#8217;s lunch, and it worked like a charm (with no sour taste from lemon juice or citric acid).</p>
<p>Here are my favorite tricks to try: <span id="more-726"></span></p>
<p>Tame your linen closet by storing sheets inside their matching pillowcases.</p>
<p>Forget tinny-sounding speakers: Place your iphone or MP3 player inside a bowl to amplify the sound.</p>
<p>Use baby powder to get sand off easily at the beach.</p>
<p>Hang a strip of heavy-duty Velcro on the wall, and stick your kids small stuffed animals to it.</p>
<p>Lost an earring, a bead, or something tiny? Slip a nylon stocking over the end of your vacuum cleaner&#8217;s hose and secure it with a rubber band and then turn it on and search the floor.</p>
<p>If you travel often for business, slip your shoes into extra hotel shower-caps to keep mud and mess off of your clean clothes.</p>
<p>Instead of lining cupcake pans with tiny paper liners, bake cupcakes directly inside ice cream cones (not the pointy sugar kind). Slather lots of icing on the top and decorate.</p>
<p>Turn your muffin tins upside down, press a chunk of pre-made cookie dough onto each cup, and bake to make fill-able cookie cups.</p>
<p>And the apple trick? Slice the apple like a tic-tac-toe board, with the stem in the center, but instead of taking it apart and throwing away the core, secure the entire apple with a rubber band around the middle, so it looks whole. The apple itself will keep the cut sides from turning brown.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day, I was sitting in a corner of my local community center&#8217;s lounge, trying to finish writing an article on deadline while my daughter was in her gymnastics class.</p>
<p>A mom and her daughter came in a few minutes after I&#8217;d settled myself into my work. She must have a child in the same gymnastics class as my daughter, because they&#8217;re there at the same time I am every week. And, every week, the same thing happens: She starts talking loudly, either to her older daughter or on her cell phone, while moving furniture around to create a space in which her daughter can do her homework. If there are books on the small table in the lounge, she dumps them on the floor with an exaggerated sigh, and then (loudly) tells her older daughter to start her homework. She glares at the two or three other people in the room if we look up from our books or our laptops. She goes through her daughter&#8217;s folder, reading comments from the teacher out loud and announcing each grade on each test.</p>
<p>Which made me think: There should really be a set of rules posted somewhere, for people who have to work in public. <span id="more-723"></span></p>
<p>Oh, look! Here&#8217;s some:</p>
<p>1. Be quiet. Even if there is no one else in the lounge or coffee shop, that doesn&#8217;t mean you get to treat it like it&#8217;s your living room. Turn off the ringer on your cell phone, and remember that other people don&#8217;t care about the details of your phone call, your kid&#8217;s test scores, or your music preferences.</p>
<p>2. Don&#8217;t hog the resources. Charge up your laptop before you arrive, so that you don&#8217;t have to monopolize an outlet. Don&#8217;t spread out your stuff in order to claim as much space as possible. Don&#8217;t block a heating vent with your backpack. Don&#8217;t leave your coat hanging into the aisle. If you are charging up your phone/laptop/whatever, keep an eye on it and unplug it when it&#8217;s sufficiently charged.</p>
<p>3. Pay rent. If you&#8217;re taking up a spot in a coffee shop for hours, at least buy a cup of coffee or a snack every now and then. Think of it as a fee for the electricity, light, and space you&#8217;re using. And be sure to tip the wait staff or server generously; the longer you stay in your spot, the fewer customers he or she gets, and that can affect his or her take-home pay.</p>
<p>4. Leave the place cleaner than when you came. It doesn&#8217;t matter if that&#8217;s not your newspaper on the seat next to you; pick it up and put it in the recycling. If you&#8217;ve spilled tea or left crumbs of scone on the tabletop, give it a quick swipe with your napkin before you leave. Working in a food-free space, like a community center or a library? Put the table or chair back in place, and leave your spot ready for the next person.</p>
<p><strong>What rules would you suggest for people working in public?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="piggy.jpg" href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/files/2008/04/piggy.jpg"><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/files/2008/04/piggy.thumbnail.jpg" alt="piggy.jpg" align="left" /></a>For years now &#8212; decades, really &#8212; I&#8217;ve challenged myself to make the most of my money. The ability to stretch a dollar or pinch a penny can mean the difference between feeling like we &#8220;have&#8221; and feeling like we &#8220;have not&#8221; when it comes to things like groceries and birthday presents for preschoolers&#8217; parties; being the breadwinner makes the process easier in some instances (I know exactly how much money is coming in and going out) and harder in others (I know exactly how much money is coming in and going on).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that, for my family, the most straight-forward and simple money-saving tricks work but, at some point, &#8220;just spend less money&#8221; or &#8220;cut out the things you don&#8217;t use&#8221; isn&#8217;t helpful advice. How do you spend less money when you&#8217;re spending it on essentials, like childcare when you work full time? What if you can&#8217;t cut out cable because you need to have high-speed internet access for your job? <span id="more-722"></span></p>
<p>Here are a few of the tips and techniques that work for my family:</p>
<p><strong>Keep using credit cards.</strong> Most get-out-of-debt experts urge you to cut up your credit cards, which is fine if you&#8217;re stuck in a deficit-spending rut. But if you choose a credit card with some sort of bonus &#8212; cash back, points, frequent flyer miles &#8212; and you pay the bill in full each month, you&#8217;re getting more for your money than just the stuff you had to buy anyway. Paying my youngest kids&#8217; daycare tuition with my frequent-flier-mile credit card usually garners us enough frequent flier miles to bring my stepkids up for an extra visit or two.</p>
<p><strong>Get an enormous freezer and buy in bulk.</strong> We have a large family &#8212; five kids, ranging in age from 18 to 5 years old, though we&#8217;re rarely all together for months at a time any more. Still, having a chest freezer in the basement means that I can take advantage of sales on otherwise expensive things (like meat) that my family likes to eat. Making meals ahead of time and freezing them saves time (and my sanity) as well; when I&#8217;m too busy to prep food and everyone is starvatious, we can heat and eat something from our own frozen restaurant instead of spending money on fast food.</p>
<p><strong>Clip only certain coupons.</strong> Yes, I absolutely do clip coupons &#8212; I have since I was a cash-strapped college student. But I only clip coupons for things I&#8217;m buying anyway. So, cheese sticks for my preschooler&#8217;s lunch box, yes; day-glo macaroni and cheese and frozen dinners, no. My favorite frugal score was a buy-one-get-one-free sale on deodorant coupled with high-value coupons and a store that had filled its shelves with &#8220;twin packs&#8221;; it brought the price down from $4.99 per stick to 99 cents each. Still gives me a bit of a thrill, to tell you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Weigh your pre-tax options. </strong>Any time your employer offers you the chance to put money aside (dependent-care or medical spending accounts, for instance) or pay for something (like your health-care premiums) on a pre-tax basis, look into it. It can lower your taxable income, for one thing and, for another, you may end up paying less out-of-pocket in the long run. Think of it this way: If you&#8217;re in the 28-percent tax bracket, you have to earn about $139 in order to spend $100 in post-tax dollars. Wouldn&#8217;t you rather put that &#8220;extra&#8221; $39 to good use? (Note: of course, this only works if you spend enough to empty the account before it expires.)</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>How do you make the most of your money?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again, we&#8217;re in the thick of <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2010/10/18/tis-the-cold-and-flu-season-here-are-5-natural-ways-to-cope/" target="_blank">cold and flu season</a>. And, once again, millions of parents are eying their sick days and wondering if they can really take any of them, even though they know they should stay out of the office when they&#8217;re sick.</p>
<p>Eighty percent of common infections can be spread through the air,  water, food, and via contact with contaminated surfaces, <span class="yshortcuts">Peter Sheldon</span>, vice president of the commercial cleaning company <a rel="nofollow" href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=11co55m3t/EXP=1328910765/**http%3A//www.coverall.com/">Coverall</a>, told me.   And the places where people are most likely to pick up germs aren&#8217;t as  obvious as you might think. <span id="more-721"></span></p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advocates washing  your hands often in order to reduce your risk of getting sick, but did  you know that washing your desk can make even more of a difference?  According to Dr. Charles Gerba, a University of Arizona researcher whose work has earned him the title of &#8220;Dr. Germ,&#8221; the average desk harbors 400 times as many bacteria as the average toilet seat. And his research shows that women&#8217;s desks are far worse than men&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found is that women seemed to have more &#8217;stuff&#8217; in their  offices, from makeup bags to pictures of family and purses on their  desks,&#8221; <a href="http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2007/02/germs-working-overtime-especially-at-women-s-desk.aspx" target="_blank">said Gerba</a>. &#8220;It added up to big numbers for women, even though  their offices typically looked cleaner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gerba&#8217;s study (which was funded by the Clorox Company) found that computer keyboards and mice were the germiest, and desk drawers were germy as well &#8212; which makes sense, since that&#8217;s where we stash makeup, snacks, and sometimes even our purses, which are the perfect vehicle for germs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women frequently place their purses on the floor just about  everywhere they go, so we&#8217;ve come to think of handbags as walking  &#8216;bag-teria,&#8217;&#8221; said Gerba. Since we&#8217;re so pressed for time, we&#8217;re more likely to eat lunch at our desks, too, and drips and crumbs can harbor bacteria.</p>
<p>Just wiping down your desk every morning can make a massive difference &#8212; even if it already looks spotless. &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing,&#8221; Sheldon said. &#8220;You can clean something and it may  look clean, but you can have thousands of bacteria and viruses on the  surface.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you ever wipe down your desk at work?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A good friend once told me that she thinks it&#8217;s hilarious that I write about work-life balance when I  have so little of it myself. I tell them that I really write about juggling work and life, my full-time career and full-on family, which means that when it comes to balance, I&#8217;m the fulcrum on which it rests, not the one who actually achieves it.</p>
<p>But still, she&#8217;s right. And now that my primary office is inside my own house, the scales have tipped way over to the work side of things. Which means that I need to do a better job of going from &#8220;work mode&#8221; to &#8220;home mode.&#8221;<span id="more-720"></span></p>
<p>When I was commuting 1 1/2 hours each way each day, I would try to make my commute <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2008/05/01/thursday-tips-the-second-shift/" target="_blank">my &#8220;me time,&#8221;</a> listening to cheesy &#8217;80s music that made my former-rock-music-critic husband roll his eyes when I turned it on at home. Now? At the end of the work day I commute downstairs to my kitchen &#8212; and I sometimes leave my smart phone, that electronic leash that binds me to work, upstairs in my office.</p>
<p>I often cook to relax, so I try to make extras of anything I&#8217;m cooking on the weekend or early in the week. That way, by the time Thursday and Friday roll around and I&#8217;d cheerfully drink a couple glasses of Malbec and call it dinner, there&#8217;s a balanced meal already in the fridge, ready to heat and eat.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing I&#8217;ve done is accept that I can&#8217;t do it all perfectly, and embrace certain short cuts.<strong> </strong>In spite of <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2010/06/14/working-moms-whats-your-superpower/" target="_blank">our superpowers</a>, we are simply human. It took me a long time to understand that having to say &#8220;this much of my to-do list is just not going to get done today&#8221; was OK and sometimes necessary and not at all a sign of failure. And it took me even longer to remember that I could fake clean the house and wash the clothes but not always fold them. And that I could tear open a bag of Orange Chicken from Trader Joe&#8217;s and heat that up for my kids instead of feeling annoyed that I couldn&#8217;t make it from scratch myself. My kids don&#8217;t mind, I get a break, and that Malbec isn&#8217;t going to drink itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you go from work mode to home mode? And what part of that juggle do you struggle with?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that my main office is inside my house, I spend more time on Facebook than I used to when I was commuting to work 40 miles away. It&#8217;s become my water cooler in a lot of ways, the place I go to catch up with coworkers, vet story ideas, and chat about the latest news.</p>
<p>But Facebook seems to change in some tiny way or another every few weeks. Between trying to navigate a new timeline to figuring out whether you follow your friends and their status feeds, it&#8217;s easy to forget to check your privacy settings. And Facebook counts on that, to some extent. <span id="more-719"></span></p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t occur to me to check until I noticed, all of a sudden, that there were little messages in my newsfeed telling me what my friends were reading on Yahoo and the Washington Post. And when I checked I noticed that my privacy settings had changed pretty much across the board to give more websites and more people way more access than I wanted them to have.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t remember whether you&#8217;ve made your Facebook photos public or private, you probably haven&#8217;t noticed whether you&#8217;ve let other websites &#8220;check in&#8221; or whether people can see what you&#8217;ve posted on other social media sites like Twitter, Flickr or Instagram (think those last two are just for photos? Think again). And plenty of other people are in the same boat.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an easy way to check and see how much access you&#8217;ve (inadvertently) given out. Go to <a href="http://mypermissions.org/" target="_blank">MyPermissions.org</a> and start clicking on the icons to see who and what people and places can do with your Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, Instagram, Yahoo, Dropbox, Google, and Twitter accounts. You may be surprised.</p>
<p>Monitoring your online privacy settings is part and parcel of managing your online reputation and protecting yourself from ID theft. Have you double-checked your permissions lately?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/files/2012/01/dv342188.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-718" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/files/2012/01/dv342188-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>A recent study of 1,364 new mothers found that, over the course of about a decade, the moms who worked at least part time were <a href="http://shine.yahoo.com/work-money/working-mothers-healthier-study-220400211.html">healthier and happier</a> than those who decided to stay home with their kids &#8212; especially when their kids were very young.</p>
<p>It sounds like the latest battle in the ongoing Mommy Wars, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. The health benefits, the happiness&#8230; I think it all boils down to whether you&#8217;re doing what you really want to be doing. <span id="more-717"></span></p>
<p>According to the study, <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=12em69die/EXP=1327006183/**http%3A//www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/fam-25-6-895.pdf">&#8220;Mothers&#8217; part-time employment: Associations with mother and family well-being,&#8221;</a> published in the December issue of the American Psychological Association&#8217;s &#8220;Journal of Family Psychology,&#8221;  being employed has multiple benefits for moms. The researchers found that those who worked anywhere form 1 to 32 hours  per week were more sensitive to their kids&#8217; needs, less likely  to have symptoms of depression, and more likely to split household  duties with their spouses than mothers who were not employed. Moms who worked full-time outside of the home were more stressed out, which makes sense, but still reported fewer symptoms of depression than stay-at-home moms &#8212; which took the researchers by surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all cases with significant differences in maternal well-being, such  as conflict between work and family or parenting, the comparison favored  part-time work over full-time or not working,&#8221; the study&#8217;s lead author,  Cheryl Buehler, professor of human development and family studies at  the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=12kgem8rt/EXP=1327006183/**http%3A//www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2011/12/working-moms.aspx">said in a statement</a>. &#8220;However, in many cases the well-being of moms working part time was no different from moms working full time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moms in the study were from 10 different states and from varying socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. Some were single moms. Some were college grads. Some never finished high school. But the health benefits of working was evident in spite of all of the differences, the researchers said. &#8220;It may be employment in general rather than the number of work hours  that protects against depressed mood when children are young,&#8221; Buehler concluded.</p>
<p>But for every woman who has told me that maternity leave was the toughest time of their lives, I know a stay-at-home mom who says she feels fulfilled by her choice drop out of the work force and focus on the kids. <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/36hourday/2010/07/19/staying-home-is-a-career-choice/" target="_blank">Staying home with your kids is a career choice</a> in my book, not a moral imperative, so  it makes sense that as long as you&#8217;re doing what you love, you&#8217;ll be  happier and healthier than someone who is logging long hours in a place  where they&#8217;d rather not be.</p>
<p>What do you think? Does working make you happier? Why or why not?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m supposed to be on vacation this week but, as usually, I have once again discovered that I don&#8217;t know how to unwind. Even when I&#8217;m not at work, I rarely feel like I can just sit still and <em>be</em>; there are people to see and chores to do and the house to (fake) clean and kids to feed/amuse/maintain. And, after a while, I feel like a wind-up toy that&#8217;s stuck in the &#8220;on&#8221; position, gears rapidly working toward burnout.</p>
<p>The problem is that, with so much on our to-do lists all the time, we working moms have conditioned ourselves to believe that really taking care of ourselves is selfish, or at least not that important. When we do it, we justify it, almost as if we feel guilty about it: We &#8220;deserve&#8221; time to ourselves, we need to &#8220;make time&#8221; to exercise. Or, at least, I do.</p>
<p>And it turns out that I&#8217;m not alone. <span id="more-716"></span></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://apahelpcenter.mediaroom.com/file.php/209/09+SIA+Release+FINAL+NO+embargo.pdf" target="blank">a survey</a> by the American Psychological Association, 75 percent of adults reported experiencing &#8220;moderate to high levels of stress&#8221; in the past month, and 42 percent said that their stress levels have increased in the past year. And more and more people don&#8217;t feel like they have the energy to deal with it.</p>
<p>According to the study:</p>
<p>47 percent of respondents report that they have lain awake at night<br />
45 percent report irritability or anger<br />
43 percent report fatigue<br />
40 percent report lack of interest, motivation or energy</p>
<p>Nearly a third of respondents report headaches, feelings of depression, and sadness; 27 percent blame stress for their upset stomachs and indigestion.</p>
<p>Though more of us are experiencing stress, fewer of us are willing to do much about it, the survey found. Some &#8212; as many as 44 percent &#8212; reported exercising or walking to relieve stress, but more people listen to music, read, watch TV or movies, or play video games to relax.</p>
<p>At <em>The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s</em> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2009/11/04/are-we-too-stressed-out-to-reduce-our-stress/">The Juggle</a>, Helen L. Coons, a clinical psychologist and a fellow of the APA, suggests that one reason people don&#8217;t tackle the long-term job of managing their stress is that they feel they don&#8217;t have enough time to do so. &#8220;We need to “reframe ‘self care’ as something that is not selfish,” she said.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually make New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but it seems like a good one: Resolve to believe that taking care of yourself isn&#8217;t selfish. Everything else &#8212; getting more sleep, getting more exercise, eating healthily, being kind to yourself &#8212; kind of falls under that big umbrella, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like you&#8217;re being selfish when you take care of yourself?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re all feeling the effects of a lackluster economic right now, so you can imagine how much tighter the budget belt must feel for people who didn&#8217;t have much to begin with. It&#8217;s become more difficult for charities to help others, too &#8212; which means that now is the perfect time to do a little bit more. Even though times are tight, there are plenty of ways to give &#8212; and to let your dollar do more than you thought it could. Here are fiveoptions: <span id="more-715"></span></p>
<p><strong>1.) Donate to individuals to help them start a business. </strong><a href="http://kiva.org" target="_blank">Kiva</a> allows you lend small amounts of money to entrepreneurs for whom a little goes a long way. Each small business&#8217; fundraising goals are quite modest &#8212; $425 for a woman to purchase used clothing to sell in Ghana, $825 for a construction business in Mozambique &#8212; and $25 helps a lot.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Give to organizations that encourage independent living. </strong>Just $20 can buy a flock of chicks for a hungry family in Tanzania, for example, providing them with a source for food as well as an income. <a href="http://www.heifer.org/site/c.edJRKQNiFiG/b.204586/" target="_blank">Heifer International</a> has many gift options at different price points, from $20 to $5,000, and the animals you underwrite are worth so much more than the money it cost to buy them.</p>
<p><strong>3.) Donate online while you&#8217;re doing other things.</strong> Click through online malls that send a portion of your purchase prices to charity, like <a href="http://www.goodsearch.com/goodshop.aspx" target="_blank">GoodShop.com</a>, or click on the buttons at <a href="http://www.greatergood.com/" target="_blank">GreaterGood.com</a> and give money without spending a cent.</p>
<p><strong>4.) Donate time instead of money.</strong> You don&#8217;t have to do it right around the holidays. Volunteer at a soup kitchen later this winter, sign up with <a href="http://www.bbbs.org/site/c.diJKKYPLJvH/b.1539751/k.BDB6/Home.htm" target="_blank">Big Brothers Big Sisters of America</a>, read to kids at a hospital&#8230; the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><strong>5.) Donate what you no longer need.</strong> The coat your child outgrew before she even had a chance to really break it in could keep another kid warm this winter if you donate it to <a href="http://www.onewarmcoat.org/" target="_blank">One Warm Coat</a> or a similar organization. <a href="http://goodwill.org/page/guest/about" target="_blank">Goodwill</a> and the <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf" target="_blank">Salvation Army</a> take items other than clothing. And those great books and DVDs you no longer read or watch could go to your local library if they&#8217;re still in great shape.</p>
