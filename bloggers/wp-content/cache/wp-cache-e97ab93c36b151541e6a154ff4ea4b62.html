		<description>Swistle/Kristen, I must say that I'm completely astonished.  I CANNOT believe that I took ONE stinking week off from blog reading and THIS, THIS!!! is what I miss.

This is big.  Knowing your name and what you look like.  

This is exciting!

And you look nothing and everything like I pictured you.  

Did I mention how shocked I am?!</description>

		<description>So glad you'll be here at WIM! One of my favorite sites EVAH. 

You and Linda make a great team! And, the "cookies" theme is pretty perfect for you, don't you think?</description>

		<description>I feel a little bit the same way about Kristen/Swistle as you do about Jean/Stimey. But I guess Kristen is good. :) What an excellent contest. It is a pleasure to gaze upon your lovely countenance!</description>

		<description>I would not have picked your picture out of a lineup.  I had constructed a vision of you in my mind completely different.  The only thing the same was your hair color.  I pictured your hair longer, and wavy.  And I thought you were heavier {blush}.</description>

		<description>Holy Mother.
I can't even believe I am seeing THE Swistle.  And her name is Kristin but with an E!! 

I would have never guessed!  BTW:  I pictured you like this but with a rounder face, so either you did a great job with the sharp jawline positioning OR you really made yourself seem more "round" than you are!  

Yeah for SWISTLE, I mean, Kristen!

p.s.  have you found that the draw back to being a part of the Kristin-Kristen family...EVERYONE spells your name wrong...especially GUYS.  What's with them always spelling it Christine?</description>

		<description>You look like I imagined you would! Very much like a Swistle. And a Kristin, for that matter.</description>

I really don't know what I was expecting but somehow you're just a little different than I thought...</description>
