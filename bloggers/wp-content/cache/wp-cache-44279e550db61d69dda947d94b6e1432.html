		<description>Great post.

The thing about going less stretch and more cotton is that cotton fades much faster.  So although, the pants will remain tight, you'll lose the color much faster.

Hanging is definitely the right thing to do.

		<description>To solve the crunchiness factor of hung-to-dry jeans I typically just wad them up and rub them against themselves (like you're trying to work Shout into a stain or hand washing them) for a second or two.  Not very technical I know, but makes them soft enough to put on and then like JennyM said, my body heat and movements take care of the rest.</description>

		<description>I'm interested to try the wee bit of fabric softener trick. I've found that even if they are a bit crunchy, just a few minutes of wear and the heat from your body will soften them up nicely.</description>

		<description>To keep my favorite jeans looking and feeling great, I dry them (inside out, as I washed them) on gentle heat and take them out while they are still fairly damp and then hang them to finish drying.  Gets rid of most of the crunch factor.  On occasions when I want to look a bit more "crisp", I give them a quick press with my steam iron.   I know no one wants to iron jeans, but they really do look great that way.</description>

		<description>Kelly is right: a wee bit of fabric softener in the wash is always nice.  You can also try using less soap (I typically use half of what the manufacturer recommends, for a large load, which is the only kind I ever do for some reason) -- the excess soap can leave things crunchy.

100% cotton jeans will tend to be stiffer than jeans with a little stretch or some polyester, because the man-made fabrics don't get so stiff.</description>

		<description>Sue, I can't speak for Susan, but I've found a tiny bit of liquid fabric softener works wonders for hanging clothes dry. 

In the warmer months I like to hang sheets and towels out to dry simply because they smell so much fresher. The bit of liquid softener keeps them from getting stiff too.</description>

		<description>Great advice.  But how do you get them soft when you air dry them?  Mine feel like sandpaper.</description>

		<description>Great advice, Susan. Thanks. You know, I have a pair of Old Navy jeans that are on the loose side and a pair on the tighter side, same style, same size. I thought it might have been an error or something. That's really interesting to know that variation is normal, given the mass-production that brings us our jeans. I will keep that in mind next time I go shopping.</description>
