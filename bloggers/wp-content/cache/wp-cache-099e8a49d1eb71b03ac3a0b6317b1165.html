		<description>I am rather glad that the recipes aren’t really delicious or that deceptive. Take that already rich Seinfelds! I also highly doubt Jessica does all that buying and puree’ing (sp?) on her own- she probably has her personal chef do it I am curious about the brownies though so maybe try those next time? For me?</description>

		<description>I absolutely love this book.  Have you tried the Aloha chicken kabobs, having them for dinner.  They are amazing.  Also, the cupcakes with yellow squash puree.  Yummy.  The brownies are good but you can taste the spinach.  Some recipes need tweaking for our families likes, but she mentions this is just what her family likes.  Give a couple other recipes a try.

		<description>I just decided to try some of the recipes from the deceptively delicious cook book. I made the macaroni and cheese 1 using cauliflour. It was terrible. I made the pink dinner pancakes. My mistake is that I didn't have ricotta cheese so I substituted with cream cheese. My roomate and her son gobbled it up though. Her son at the pancakes first prior to anything else. The turkey chili was an absolute hit with me. I regret setting some aside and giving it to my roomate. I ate so much of it in one sitting. I also didn't have the red pepper puree so I substituted it for 1 full cup of carrot puree instead of half a cup. Some kids might be sensitive to the chili powder so I would try a bit less if for them. Or just have cornbread on hand. That macaroni and cheese.... don't eat it.</description>

		<description>Jada, I agree with you.  

While I am not a particularly healthly person, I am much more concerned about what my child eats.  In our house, there is no need to hide anything in chicken nuggets because chicken nuggets (or any other processed meat for that matter) has ever crossed our doorstep.

Your mention of tasty ways to prepare veggies is so true.  I didn't learn to love veggies until I discovered that they didn't need to come from a can!

My kid will chow down steamed broccoli dressed with lemon juice, a bit of melted butter and grated parm cheese.</description>

		<description>This book is so pointless if you feed your children right in the first place. Of course, they WILL be picky in the first years but they will eat many vegetables and most sweet fruits if you start them on this path when they begin eating solid foods. Just serve them veggies and don't make a fuss if they pass over certain ones. Take note and don't serve those again for a few weeks.

Serve them in tasty ways too instead of just as a limp steamed side dish. I come from a family of Seventh Day Adventist vegetarians and we children always ate our vegetables willingly. One of my favorite foods to this day is brussels sprouts in lemon pepper and butter sauce. Kids will eat most anything with cheese in it so try things like lasagna packed with good things like spinach (fresh - frozen and especially canned are nasty and mushy and children usually won't like them as texture is important to them) or one of my favorite recipes is to make mac and cheese (we like Annie's Bunny Shaped because it's all natural and fun but any brand or homemade recipe works) and mix in peas, corn and steamed baby broccoli and baby carrots to the finished product. I got the idea from my sister who tells her children a charming tale bunnies gathering vegetables on a farm during meal time.

If you don't give your children vegetables in their intended form, their tastebuds will not mature and they will instead have a taste only for junk food just like all the parents who let their kids eat whatever junk they wanted.</description>

		<description>I have the Sneaky Chef and so for I don't think it's too bad.  I haven't tried any of her recipes yet,  but I've made one of the purees which she says you can add to boxed mac 'n cheese -- it's got zucchini and cauliflower.  My husband hates both, but never even noticed that it's been added to the cheese sauce. And I made her flour mixture (regular, whole wheat and wheat germ), which has worked ok as a replacement for regular flour in my muffin recipes. My toddler eats very little outside of dairy, crackers, baby carrots and fruit, so I'm all about trying to sneak some stuff in!  Thanks for experimenting w/the Seinfeld book, now I'll stick to the Sneaky Chef and not bother w/trying the other one out!</description>

		<description>Mrs. Seinfeld did crack me up when she said that she sets out a box of store bought macaroni &#38; cheese on the counter while she makes the other m &#38; c w/pureed veggies and the kids just assume that's what she's using.  Her kids must not be as nosy as my kids.  Not even my 2 year old would fall for that.  Its a cute idea though.</description>

		<description>I've become a freak about "fake food" since reading the book Real Food by Nina Planck. Hence my comment about fat-free cream cheese. It's not just the ingredients, but the process the one-natural food had to go through to become fat-free. Here's a sampling:

"Conventional processes for producing low fat or fat free cream cheese products suffer from a number of deficiencies. One major deficiency is that these processes generally produce products which fail to approximate the flavor and texture of traditional cream cheese. Moreover, complicated, cumbersome and inefficient apparati are typically employed to accommodate the extensive mixing, shearing and heating steps required in these processes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,024, for example, describes a process for manufacturing a fat free cream cheese product which requires an apparatus which includes two homogenizers as well as three separate mixing vessels in sequence. These vessels provide a specific degree of agitation and shear at successive points in the process. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,180,604 describes a process for making a fat free cream cheese in an apparatus which requires only one vessel. The apparatus, however, is severely limited with respect to the amount of product produced per batch. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an efficient process and apparatus for producing a low fat or fat free cream cheese product which closely resembles traditional cream cheese in flavor and texture."
