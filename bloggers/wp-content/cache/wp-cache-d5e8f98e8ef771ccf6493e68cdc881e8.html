		<description>I think us women will be judged no matter what we do!  I have no children yet, and all I hear is "why don't you have kids?" and a million other questions regarding why.  I'll tell you why, because we live in one of the most expensive places in the world, we make $100,000 a year and it barely covers us to own a condo!  How are we supposed to afford a child when daycare here is $900 a month?  When we both work graveyard?

This world is full of people who just want to judge everyone they come across, and it will never end.  My suggestion?  Tell them your uterus isn't up for discussion and walk away.</description>

		<description>I am in the same boat. I have a 2 year old with, at least for now, no plans to have another. My husband and I both work full time, and we have just enough to pay our necessities and save a little each month, and still have some left over for a few fun things. We live in a developing country, though, and in the middle class here, it's far more common to only have one  or two children, because the cost of living is fairly high and the salaries low. If we had another one we'd probably have to sacrifice our savings and forget our fun.... People here understand that, but I think in the US, where I am from, people tend to have more resources, and a better welfare system, and the financial stress isn't as great in general. The  part that sucks the most? All baby items are imported here because the country doesn't produce their own, and importation taxes are astronomical, meaning a plastic sippy cup runs anywhere between 10 to 25 dollars...

Finances aside, even if we were in a better place with money, my body really popped right back into place after the first one. No marks, no extra fat, and with only one I have time to take care of myself, I still can exercise and do things I enough that make me healthier and happier. As selfish as it may seem, I don't think I want to chance sacrificing that. I mean, why should I be obligated to give up things that I don't want to give up for another potential person who doesn't exist yet (and probably never will).In the long run, I think it would only make me bitter and resentful. I don't want to be a martyr, I'd rather just be happy.</description>

		<description>People are super judgmental. It's just part of our genetic make-up. If we're not complaining about one thing, then we're complaining about something else.</description>

		<description>having one child is amazing! My son Brendan has gotten all of my time and attention!  I have watched many parents including family struggle to make it to one child's event because they have to tend to their other children?...Sure it's great for them to have siblings to play with..but it's great that you can play with then..for example..on a Friday night I would turn the lights out and turn on our star wars light sabers... best match ever not to mention fantastic memories! What ever you decide have one child can be great..less stress more fun!</description>

		<description>I wouldn't take peoples comments about a second child so personally.  We have all been there in conversation with our girlfriends.  Most the time I think people just want good stuff to talk about not that they really care either way.

For me, I have a 6 month old baby boy.  Being an only child myself I thought I would have another....but then reality set in.  Babies are alot of work!  I am a working mom and this is by far the toughest job I have ever done.  Between the cooking, cleaning and taking care of baby, husband, and myself there's no time for another child.  I would feel like I failed my second child if I couldn't give them the rich life I plan on giving the first.</description>

		<description>I am also dealing withsame issue my son is 8.and @ times I feel guilty for not giving him more...but I have a lot of health issues family medical history well is really not something I want to pass on...
I am in the middle of making a desicion of hysterectomy...I am 34 :( 
People don't know everything and really should mind their own buisiness.
Good luck to you and your completed family and while I am learning to accept that I am catholic ("were suppose to have ginormic families")
And I am only blessed with one ..we truly are complete even if I'm the only one who doesn't quite know it yet.</description>

		<description>There's nothing shallow in saying by having only one child you can provide that child with a richer life in shared experiences - whether it be having the means to travel the world or simply by being able to read them a story before bed because you do not have to work two jobs to support a litter of children. 

I think it's incredibly offensive to believe that the definition of FAMILY is more than one child. My family is my son, my husband and myself and I think it's perfect. 

It's amazing that people feel it's ok to question when someone decides to only have one child but you wouldn't think of saying, "What? A fourth?? Are you nuts? Why would you do that???" No, that would be considered... impolite. ;)</description>

		<description>I'm shocked wt some of the shallowness I see here.

I wouldnt trade any of my children--or siblings, for that matter--for all the European vacations in the world, or for any amount of money.

Perhaps, being the child of a Holocaust survivor, I have a slightly different perspective.

In our family, nothing, NOTHING, is more important than family.

More children = more love and support.  Not more competition for $ or attention.  Those have never, ever been sn issue.</description>

		<description>We definitely are thinking of having only one child. We both had siblings that were 10+ years difference in age from us so we were in similar situations to an only child and enjoyed it. I never wanted children so the fact that I went out on a limb and decided to have even one was a big deal! When we use the money we would have spent on her sibling to take her on European vacations, I'm sure she won't be sad that she is an only child.</description>

		<description>I would like to comment on what Caroline said.  I think it's wrong to label anyone selfish when you are not privy to each individual situation.  I believe that as long as you love your children or child as the case may be, unconditionally and strive to be the best parent you can be then noone has the right to label you selfish.   The bottom line is everyone has the right to choose the size of their family.  I know several "only" children that have had the happiest of childhoods and  by no means regret being the "only "  child.  I think it's all about the individual experience.  There is no right or wrong, there is just what works best for each family.  My husband and I both work and my daughter is in day care for 11 hours a day.  I would not mind having a second child but that would mean two children in daycare all day.  In my opinion, that would be selfish.  As I said, each situation is different and unique to that family.  To say that parents who have only one child are saying "let's see if we can do this"  rather than "let's have a family" is beyond wrong...it's ignorant.  My husband, myself and my daughter are, indeed, a family and I love my little family.  You certainly have no right to say otherwise.  You are obviously a very angry person Caroline.  Don't take your anger out on the rest of us who are totally happy having one child.</description>
