A lot of said protein comes from a local ranch (beef) as well as the deer (and bear!) my husband has hunted, harvested, and had processed by a butcher. We also have chickens; some for meat, some for eggs.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re doing all that we can to be sustainable.</p>
<p><span id="more-776"></span>I know that some people choose to be vegetarian and, hey. Good for you. I mean it. Other people think that hunting or butchering chickens is weird &#8230; but will buy chickens that came from origins such as those portrayed in Food, Inc. Again, good for you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not here to convert anyone, I&#8217;m just sharing what we&#8217;ve chosen to do. My husband is more than willing to hunt, harvest, and raise our food sources. My job is to cook them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you and your spouse share the same views on food choices? Is one of you a vegetarian and the other not? Is one a hunter and the other &#8230; opposed? I&#8217;d love to hear about your choice, and why you made it.</em></strong></p>

You will meet him (or her) and you will discover that you are the other half of each others&#8217; puzzle. Romantic music will play in the background and you will live your lives together in a state of romantic comedy-esque bliss.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I believe that there is one &#8217;soul mate&#8217; for every person because, well, the Earth has a lot of human inhabitants. That said, I cannot imagine being married to anyone other that my husband. We have our differences, of course &#8212; he is a pessimist (he says he&#8217;s a &#8216;realist&#8217;) and I am the eternal optimist.</p>
<p><span id="more-773"></span>Those different perspectives aside, we are wired a lot alike. We have the same faith, the same family values, the same sense of humor, the same frugal nature, the same desire for a clean home, the same desire to live a fit and healthy life.</p>
<p>(He may or may not be more frugal and a bit more <em>anal</em> about the house cleaning, but we can joke about it. Because it&#8217;s either that or cry about it. I&#8217;m kidding. Ish.)</p>
<p>All of that to say that I don&#8217;t know if my husband is my &#8217;soul mate&#8217;, but he&#8217;s the perfect man <em>for me</em> and I honestly don&#8217;t know how it could be any better.</p>
<p><strong><em>How about you? Do you believe in soul mates? Are you married to yours?</em></strong></p>

This is the first time that both boys have been away at camp &#8212; or anywhere &#8212; without their sister, so I proposed that she and I take a girls&#8217; trip. We hopped in the van and hit the road.</p>
<p><span id="more-772"></span>We&#8217;re spending the week staying in the big city with grandparents and aunties and cousins and having a great time, just the two of us. It&#8217;s the first time that our family has taken separate vacations and I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be the last. Don&#8217;t get me wrong - we would prefer to be all together - but this trip of ours is a lot more fun than staying home while the boys are having a week of adventure.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/committedtiesthatbond/files/2012/07/istock_000008572486xsmall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-771" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/committedtiesthatbond/files/2012/07/istock_000008572486xsmall-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="165" /></a>I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;ve read a hundred posts by now about the fact that Katie Holmes filed for divorce from Tom Cruise. There is much speculation about the <em>why</em> (Scientology weirdness being the main reason), but who really knows? Maybe he&#8217;s not the same smiling/happy guy he is for the public, or one hundred other possible reasons. Their impending divorce got me thinking about celebrity divorces in general.</p>
<p><span id="more-770"></span>The media likes to run with the idea that marriage is <em>harder</em> for celebrities. They have to be in the public eye, they may have conflicting work schedules, there is so much <em>pressure</em>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any harder for them than it is for us mere mortals, honestly. We all live in communities where other people get to watch our marriage in action. If you live in a small community &#8212; as we do &#8212; everybody knows you.</p>
<p>Conflicting work schedules happen for my husband and I, as well as for many of our friends. It&#8217;s a fact of life if both spouses work.</p>
<p>As for the pressure &#8230; life is full of pressure. Pressure from our work, pressure from our families, pressure from our own expectations.</p>
<p>Marriage is <em>hard</em>, regardless of your social stature or celebrity status.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think? Is marriage harder for celebrities?</strong></em></p>

<p><span id="more-768"></span>If it&#8217;s getting late, and the discussion is heated, the odds of getting it settled are kind of against you. You&#8217;re tired, emotional, and possibly not your most rational self. Agree to a cease-fire, go to sleep, and look at the issue with fresh (and rested) eyes in the morning. We&#8217;ve often found that whatever the issue was, it&#8217;s not as big as it seemed the night before and we put it behind us with a hug and mutual &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221; statements.</p>

She commented that it had been far too long since they went away together &#8212; it&#8217;s been almost a year. They have a great support system and a lot of family nearby, which means that they can leave their kids in good hands and enjoy time away together.</p>
<p><span id="more-764"></span>We don&#8217;t have that same kind of support because our extended family is pretty far flung. We did manage to go to <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/committedtiesthatbond/2010/05/25/where-do-you-go-to-get-away/" target="_blank">Las Vegas for our tenth anniversary</a> two years ago, and we went to Mexico for a week five years ago, but we definitely don&#8217;t have frequent weekends (or even nights) away. We do manage to get out on a date night every two weeks or so, which is no small feat.</p>
<p><strong><em>How about you? Do you go away together often, or is it a rare occasion?</em></strong></p>

<p>Aside from soccer, our weekends are pretty wide open. Friday nights are &#8220;pub night&#8221; (homemade pizza and appetizers) and Saturday nights alternate between family time and date night. Date nights are a necessity for us in order to keep us connected.</p>
<p>Sunday is church in the morning and we try to keep Sunday afternoons pretty low-key. We play outside, we go on hikes, we eat a steak dinner, we recharge before Monday rears its ugly head.</p>

Because I am a numbers girl, I managed our finances from the beginning of our marriage. Budgets and spreadsheets and mortgage payments, oh my!</p>
<p>Then I went back to work full-time when my husband was working part-time, and I released the reins. Long work days plus an hour commute meant that I simply did not have time to stay on top of everything. He stepped up, and has been on the ball with bill payments and budgets and all of the things a non-accountant only does because he has to. (We have always talked about everything and where we&#8217;re at financially, but <em>someone</em> has to do all of the banking/budgeting.)</p>
<p><span id="more-760"></span>I&#8217;m back working from home and he&#8217;s working full-time away from home, so it only makes sense that I take over again. It&#8217;s a little odd, because I honestly <em>let that go</em>, so I need to get re-acquainted with all that&#8217;s involved.</p>

They have each been divorced a couple of times over, and I wouldn&#8217;t call their splits &#8216;friendly&#8217;. Well, except for my Dad&#8217;s divorce from his third wife, who I call Mom (It&#8217;s complicated). It was a rocky split at the beginning, but they have worked out a pretty good system for parenting their four kids. They are in no way BFF&#8217;s, nor do they hang out, but they don&#8217;t harbor anger and vent it in front of the kids.</p>
<p><span id="more-758"></span>My Mom, on the other hand, is still angry and volatile about her and my Dad divorcing &#8230; 33 years ago. Its time to <em>let it go</em>.</p>
<p>I read a post at Cafe Mom about how <a href="http://thestir.cafemom.com/love_sex/139048/courteney_cox_david_arquette_divorce" target="_blank">Courtney Cox and David Arquette have worked through their divorce</a>, while not even using lawyers. They even work together, and hang out together, still.</p>
<p>My friend Jen wrote a guest post over at our friend Tracey&#8217;s blog titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.sweetney.com/2012/06/an-ex-spouse-is-just-a-friend-you-havent-met-yet.html" target="_blank">An Ex-Spouse Is Just A Friend You Haven&#8217;t Met Yet</a>.&#8221; It is a must-read, if ever there was a must read, when it comes to divorcing amicably.</p>
<p>I have no plan to be divorced, nor does my husband, but these stories make me happy because if my parents were even half as awesome as these two couples, life would have been a whole heck of a lot better growing up.</p>
<p><em><strong>For those of you who are divorced, did you have a &#8216;friendly&#8217; divorce? Or, if you are a child of divorce, did your parents do a good job of keeping it amicable?</strong></em></p>
