<p class="MsoNormal">Everyone has had that moment… you know, the moment when your kid blatantly stares at someone or says something embarrassing in public. I’m no different, my kids have said and done things I’d rather they hadn’t but little by little I believe we’re at the very least teaching them the right way to approach people who are different. This is important to me because my youngest was born with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbrachydactyly" target="_blank">symbrachydactyly</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbrachydactyly" target="_blank"></a>, which means his left hand wasn’t fully developed and along with a smaller than normal thumb, he’s missing his fingers on that hand. We definitely notice others checking out his hand while we are in public, it’s only normal since it is different. I see those opportunities as a chance to help educate others about limb differences (our particular brand of difference but you get the same kind of looks whether you are missing a hand, in a wheelchair or wear a patch over your eye).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span id="more-556"></span>Yes, I wish people didn’t stare, but I get why they do (and why I used to do it more myself). But more than the staring, I wish they didn’t whisper to each other or keep their children from asking questions because it is nothing I’m embarrassed about and nothing my son should ever feel the need to keep hidden. But children react the way they do because they don’t know any other way and as a parent, it’s our/my job to teach them what to do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here are some things you can do to help your kids react in a better, or more helpful, way to people who have physical differences:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Give them a vocabulary to use.</strong> Rather than asking, “What is <em>wrong</em> with that person?” teach them to ask, “What happened?” or “Why are they different?” The word “wrong” implies just what it says, that something that makes someone different is something that is wrong, or even worse, bad. We don’t say it’s wrong for a person to have curly hair or freckles, just like it’s not wrong for them to wear glasses or use a walker.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2. Lead by example.</strong> If you whisper in hushed tones about someone you see who is different, your kids will eventually pick up on the idea that it is something to be talked about in secret and should be avoided – which is not at all true, it just could be handled better. I try to encourage my kids to ask people questions if they are curious about something they see – which would never have been my first instinct before I had my son. But with Jack, I welcome people asking about his hand because it gives me the chance to say explain his limb difference and say (so he can hear) that he was just born that way, because that’s the way God made him. Often children are concerned about Jack’s hand because they think he hurt it or it is hurting him, or they wonder if it will continue growing into a full hand – allowing them to ask those questions clears up any confusion and the next time they encounter someone with a similar limb difference, I like to think they will be more open to asking about it, or be understanding of it and in turn more accepting of that person.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>3. Point out how we are all different in some way.</strong> My eldest son told me he didn’t like a particular kid on his soccer team because that child had curly hair (which honestly made me laugh) but I explained to him that not liking someone because of a difference they had no control over didn’t make any sense. I asked how it would make him feel if someone told him they didn’t like him because his hair was straight or if someone said they didn’t like his brother because of his little hand. He agreed that those weren’t good reasons not to like someone. Talking things like this out with your kids helps take the mystery away and allows them to understand why people are different.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>4. Champion a cause.</strong> We support the <a href="http://luckyfinproject.org/" target="_blank">Lucky Fin Project</a> <a href="http://luckyfinproject.org/" target="_blank"></a>which was started by another mother with a daughter who has a “lucky fin” like our son (and like Nemo from <em>Finding Nemo</em>). The non-profit promotes awareness and supports education about limb differences, but there are many causes similar to this that you can pick from. It provides a learning opportunity for your children, which in turn leads them to be more empathetic and understanding towards people who are different from them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have a child who has a difference of some kind, just keep encouraging and loving them so they never have a chance to believe there is something their difference could keep them from doing. We were lucky enough to meet former Major League pitcher <a href="http://www.jimabbott.net/" target="_blank">Jim Abbott</a> <a href="http://www.jimabbott.net/" target="_blank"></a>this spring, ironic since being a pitcher was one thing I initially mentioned that Jack probably wouldn’t be able to do when he was born. Jim was born with a right arm that ended just above his wrist and he not only pitched on his high school baseball team, but also for the 1988 Olympic team and the New York Yankees (pitching a no-hitter for them in 1993). I’ve learned quickly to never say that either of my children can’t or won’t do something, unless I’d like to be proven wrong (but then, that’s all of parenting for you).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><strong>Do you have any tips that you&#8217;s like to add?</strong></em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/05/istock_000008295173xsmall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-555" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/05/istock_000008295173xsmall-294x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="228" /></a><strong><em>By Janssen from <a href="http://everydayreading.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">Everyday Reading</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/everydayreading" target="_blank">Twitter</a></em></strong></p>
<p>You hate to sound like that braggy parent who says, &#8220;I just can&#8217;t  find enough books for my child to read,&#8221; but, when your child is an avid  reader, keeping them in books can be a full-time job. And if your child  <em>isn&#8217;t </em>an avid reader, finding books to help entice them to become one can be just as frustrating.</p>
<p>As  a former school librarian, a parent, and an avid reader myself, I&#8217;m  always looking for new book recommendations (and I find pulling books  off the shelf of the library to be a deeply discouraging way to find new  material).</p>
<p>Here are five ways I love to find something new to read:</p>
<p><span id="more-554"></span><strong>1) The <a href="http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/caldecottmedal" target="_blank">Caldecott</a> (picture books) and <a href="http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal" target="_blank">Newbery</a> (juvenile literature) award lists. </strong></p>
<p>These awards have been around for  nearly 100 years. I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that they do, on occasion,  choose complete losers, but overall, I think the recommendations are  really solid, and I&#8217;ve found that the Honor books are often even better  than the winning books. Plus, because the awards are so old, you&#8217;re  likely to find books you&#8217;d forgotten you (and maybe even YOUR parent)  loved as a child on there. And another bonus is that libraries pretty  much always buy and keep the winners, so you shouldn&#8217;t have trouble  tracking them down.</p>
<p><strong>2) The Texas Library Association  puts out killer booklists every year (usually about 20 books per list)  for a whole range of ages. </strong></p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t just say this because I&#8217;m a  Texas-trained librarian - it&#8217;s one of the biggest library associations  and the sheer number of librarians and resources the state has means  you&#8217;re getting some well-researched titles. The <a href="http://www.txla.org/groups/2x2-previous" target="_blank">2&#215;2 list</a> is for 2 year olds to 2nd graders, the <a href="http://www.txla.org/TBA-booklists" target="_blank">Bluebonnet list</a> is for 3-6 graders, the <a href="http://www.txla.org/groups/lone-star" target="_blank">Lone Star list</a> is for 6 - 8 graders, the <a href="http://www.txla.org/groups/tayshas" target="_blank">TAYSHAS list</a> is for high school students, and the <a href="http://www.txla.org/groups/Maverick" target="_blank">Maverick list</a> is graphic novels divided into age groups from 6 graders to adults. I dare you not to find something you love.</p>
<p><strong>3) The <a href="http://www.salemstate.edu/academics/schools/3698.php" target="_blank">Massachusetts Children&#8217;s Book Award</a> is a yearly list of 20 books published in the last five years</strong> and aimed  at grades 4-6. I used this list heavily as an elementary school  librarian and it has a broad range of genres and levels (from barely  chapter books to hefty novels).</p>
<p><strong>4) <a href="http://www.chinaberry.com/" target="_blank">Chinaberry</a>.</strong> I love that this gets called &#8220;A Catalog That Operates Like an Independent Book Store.&#8221; I remember my mom getting this free catalog in the mail when I was young and I&#8217;d spend hours poring over it. You can request a copy and spend your entire evening reading it too.</p>
<p><strong>5) Publisher catalogs.</strong> I get some of these in  the mail and my little daughter LOVES poring over them. We mark books  to buy or get from the library and she loses her mind with excitement  when she sees books she recognizes in the backlist section. They are  also accessible online, and I find them invaluable. Here are a couple to  start you out: <a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/landing-pages/catalogs/" target="_blank">Chronicle</a>, <a href="http://booksellers.penguin.com/static/html/catalogs.html#yr" target="_blank">Penguin</a>, and <a href="http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/hmh/site/hmhbooks/home/booksellers/catalogs" target="_blank">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a>. Have a pen and paper handy to make a list of all the things you now must read immediately.</p>
<p>(And, of course, don&#8217;t forget to ask your librarian or your  child&#8217;s teacher for recommendations - I&#8217;ve yet to meet one who isn&#8217;t  dying to share a couple of their favorite books with you).</p>
<p><em><strong>Where do you go when you are looking for new reads for you or your child?</strong></em></p>

<div style="margin: 1ex">
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/05/blog-pic-4.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />Hi. My name is Rebecca, and I am <span style="font-style: italic">that</span><span style="font-style: normal"> Mom who brings homemade food to your kid&#8217;s birthday party. (Insert  cringe here).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><span style="font-style: normal">A few years  ago, at my wits end, and my son&#8217;s wits end, we made a radical change.  After months of doctors waiting rooms and a solid diagnosis we were  told to accept that our 4 year old boy Seth had Autism Spectrum Disorder  and ADHD. When advice for handling the behaviour didn&#8217;t work, and the  medication caused nasty side effects I was over the whole system.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><span id="more-551"></span><span style="font-style: normal">One day in  the middle of tears and feeling like a royal failure, another mother  reached out to me. She shared about how diet change had healed her son.  I listened intently. Sobbed a little, hung up the phone and went to  my kitchen. With the lid off the garbage can I pitched everything with  gluten and dairy from every shelf and the refrigerator. (In hindsight,  donating the food would&#8217;ve been a better option, but stick with me here.  It was a dramatic moment.)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><span style="font-style: normal">From January  16, 2010 to now Seth has been on a gluten-free, casein-free diet. Within  six weeks the ADHD calmed, and the Autistic behaviours vanished. He  is thriving in school, making friends, and happily sleeping through  the night (formerly a phenomenon).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><span style="font-style: normal">Back to my  point…</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><span style="font-style: normal">I won&#8217;t let  him eat the birthday cake at your kid&#8217;s party. That right there makes  me sound so very mean. But before the reaction to your double chocolate,  rainbow coloured cake will subside, we will have been through 1-3 weeks  of meltdowns. That includes screaming, impulsive aggression, lack of  focus, and homework needing 3-4 hours to be completed. Let&#8217;s be honest.  It&#8217;s never good for anyone in the family when homework takes that long  for a first grader. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><span style="font-style: normal">I used to  feel awful for &#8220;depriving&#8221; my son of the small goodies in  life. Now I don&#8217;t. He enjoys a wide variety of fun things that suit  his specific needs. All the while his teeth will rot the same as your  children&#8217;s teeth on halloween. And I used to hate the gawks from the  parents who didn&#8217;t care to understand what it was like to be bringing  a lunch box in on school pizza day. But I kept going.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><span style="font-style: normal">Now I smile. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><span style="font-style: normal">And if asked,  I will share my passion for food, and health and how Seth is such an  amazing little boy that we finally got to know when his eating habits  were altered. I never apologize for the lack of milk in my fridge when  guests are over. Almond milk is nice too. I will serve coconut ice-cream  and make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on GF/CF bread (crusts optional).  Barbecues happen weekly with the neighbours and I am sure keep Seth&#8217;s  burger away from their cheese. No harm done. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt;margin-right: 0pt"><span style="font-style: normal">I am proud  of what our family has learned and applied in the last few years. What  worked for us doesn&#8217;t work for everyone. But please keep inviting the  kid whose mom refuses cake, to your children&#8217;s birthday parties. We  like a piñata as much as the next family…</span></p>

<p>If you’ve got an iPhone, and if you would like to learn how to take the photo on the left and make it look like the photo on the right, you’re in the right place.<br />
<a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-1a-sidebyside.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-542" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-1a-sidebyside-300x145.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="145" /></a><br />
When I got my first smart phone, an iPhone 3G, I had no idea that it would have such decent camera ability, but it didn’t take long for me to fall in love with it. Now, two years later and in a household that boasts about 10 to 15 cameras, my iPhone, now an iPhone 4, is just about the only piece of camera equipment I ever use.</p>
<p>I’m not the only one who’s fallen for its charms. iPhoneographers are everywhere these days, and it’s easy to see why once you realize just how much power a few easy camera apps can wield. I have three favourite, go-to camera apps right now that make it easy to create good-looking images: <a href="http://campl.us/" target="_blank">Camera+</a> ($0.99), <a href="http://www.snapseed.com/" target="_blank">Snapseed</a> ($4.99), and <a href="http://www.iphoneclan.com/noisemaster/" target="_blank">Noise Master</a> ($1.99).</p>
<p>Although the price might seem steeper, these apps are well worth the $7.97 I spent on them, and, once you’ve played with them a bit, you’ll look like a master iPhoneographer. I wouldn’t leave home without them, so download those three apps and let me show you how to take a washed out, blurry photo from boring to ooh la la.</p>
<p><strong>Camera+</strong></p>
<p>Open Camera+. Tap the camera icon at the bottom left to open the camera if it is not already open. Point your iPhone at your subject. Tap the screen on the image where you would like the lens to focus, and then tap the camera button to take a picture.</p>
<p>As you can see, I took a pretty terrible picture. It’s always better to be able to start with a properly blocked, focused, and lit image, but I want to show you that even images shot on the fly can be turned into decent photos. So, if your image isn’t stellar right away, don’t sweat it.</p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-1b-unedited.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-543" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-1b-unedited-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>After you’ve taken your photo, go to your Camera+ image gallery by tapping on the tiny thumbnail at the bottom left, and choose your photo from the gallery for editing.</p>
<p>My goal at this point is only to brighten the photo before further editing in Snapseed. You can see what setting I chose in the image below.</p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-2-camplusedit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-544" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-2-camplusedit-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Feel free to play around with the different settings to see what they can do, but remember that we will be doing the majority of our editing in Snapseed, so, for this tutorial, keep it simple.</p>
<p>Voilà!</p>

<p>When you are done editing your photo, tap Done in the top right corner, and then tap Save near the bottom right. Close Camera+.</p>
<p><strong>Snapseed</strong></p>
<p>Open Snapseed. Tap Open at the top left, choose Photo Library, and then choose the last edited version of your photo from the photo gallery.</p>
<p>There are a number of options along the bottom of the screen. I opted to alter this particular photo using Tune Image (pictured below), which generally adjust elements of colour and brightness, Crop, which allows you to crop your photo, and Details, which sharpens the edges and image details.</p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-4-5-snapseed.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-547" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-4-5-snapseed-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a></p>
<p>Swipe your finger up and down to use the menu, as pictured at left, and swipe your finger left to right to adjust the value of any menu item, as pictured at right.</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to sharpen your image quite a bit at this point — I used the full 100% — because we are going to cut down on image noise with the Noise Master, and the image will lose some detail if it is not already quite sharp.</p>
<p>Here is the photo so far after our Camera+ and Snapseed treatments:</p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-6-snapseedpostedit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-548" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-6-snapseedpostedit-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>When you are done editing your photo, tap the icon in the top right corner, and then tap Save to Photo Library. Close Snapseed.</p>
<p><strong>Noise Master</strong></p>
<p>Open Noise Master. Tap Load from ‘Photos’. Pick the last edited image from your photo gallery.</p>
<p>Put your thumb and forefinger on the screen, and, instead of pinching them together, pull them apart from each other to enlarge your photo. You won’t be able to see your whole photo when it is enlarged, but you will be able to see how much blur you are actually creating to keep you from overdoing it.</p>
<p>Use the slider at the bottom to create more and less noise reduction until you figure out which level you like the best.</p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-7-8-noisemaster.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-549" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-7-8-noisemaster-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a></p>
<p>I used 25% noise reduction for my photo:</p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-10-extraedits.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-550" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/04/schmutzie-10-extraedits-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>When you are done editing your photo, tap Save in the top right corner. Close Noise Master.</p>
<p>It’s not too shabby for a photo that started out with a whole lot of problems, but I still didn’t feel done with this photo, though, so I opened up Snapseed again to adjust it for structure, focus, and saturation using the Details and Tilt-Shift options to give it a little more pop, and behold!</p>
<p>If I haven’t convinced you of the value of these three apps yet, just take a look at the first and last images side by side:</p>
<p>Camera+, Snapseed, and Noise Master are truly a trifecta of awesome when it comes to iPhoneography. They allow you to shoot photos under less desirable conditions and still create images you love, which is fantastic for those moments when you don’t have the time or opportunity to choose the best lighting or have everyone hold still for that perfect shot.</p>
<p><em><strong>I’d love to see what you create, so, if you edit any photos using this tutorial, please link to them in the comments! And have fun!</strong></em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>By Amanda from <a href="http://thebestmomontheblock.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">The Best Mom On The Block</a></strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/03/icedcoffee.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-540" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/03/icedcoffee-230x300.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="300" /></a>I am a coffee addict. Have been since I was five and my grandma started sharing her morning pot with me (more cream and sugar than coffee but it did the trick!). There’s nothing I love more than the smell of coffee brewing, and my hands wrapped around a big mug first thing in the morning is the best way to start my day. I curl up in my husband’s chair sipping and checking my social media accounts as my kids sleepily watch cartoons and play. (Sounds idyllic doesn’t it? It’s more “chaotic” than that but the coffee helps with the rose colored glasses!)</p>
<p>When the temperatures outside start to creep up I love to trade in my hot mug for a cold glass of iced coffee. I refuse to pay coffee chain prices for my daily fix (or three) so I started making a big pitcher at home to enjoy whenever I want! It’s pennies a glass and just as yummy as any glass you can get at a coffee shop. Slightly sweet and indulgently creamy, this iced coffee will be the perfect start to your day.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-539"></span><strong>Home Brewed Iced Coffee</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>8 c. brewed coffee (I do 1 standard scoop coffee grinds to 2 cups of water)<br />
2/3 c. sugar<br />
2 tbsp. vanilla extract<br />
5% light cream<br />
ice<br />
garnishes of your choice</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Brew your favourite blend of coffee to your desired strength.<br />
2. Pour hot coffee into a pitcher and add sugar. Stir to dissolve.<br />
3. Add vanilla and refrigerate until cold.<br />
4. Pour desired amount of cream (or milk) into a glass filled with ice. Add coffee and stir to mix.<br />
5. Top with whipped cream, chocolate covered espresso beans, cocoa powder, cinnamon or whatever else you like.</p>
<p><em>Variations: For an iced mocha add a squeeze of chocolate syrup or substitute chocolate milk for the cream; use coconut milk for a delicious twist; fill an ice cube tray with coffee and freeze for ice cubes that won’t dilute your drink.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Are you an iced coffee fan? Do you have any recipes that you&#8217;d like to share?</strong></em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Heather from <a href="http://www.domesticextraordinaire.com/" target="_blank">Domestic Extraordinaire</a></em></p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/03/thriftstore.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-538" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/03/thriftstore-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="214" /></a>I&#8217;m not sure when I hit my first thrift store, I think it was probably  when my oldest was a toddler.  I was amazed at all of the stuff and the  prices!  I love shopping and finding a good deal and in my mind I had  hit the jackpot!</p>
<p>90% of my wardrobe has come from thrift stores and resale shops.  The  other 10% has come from clearance racks.  I hardly ever pay full price  for an outfit and truth be told, I have a hard time paying full price at  the thrift stores.  My teenage girls mock me unmercifully about this  fact.</p>
<p>Many people compliment me on my outfits and are very surprised when I  tell them either where I got it or how much the outfit cost.  They  always proclaim that they never find anything worth while anytime they  decided to pop into a thrift store or resale shop.  So today, I will  share my thrifty secrets with you, so you too can have a killer wardrobe  at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p><span id="more-537"></span>First of all, 8 times out of 10 I walk out of thrift shops with nothing.  Other times I walk out with a piece or two.  My wallet actually groans a  bit when I hit a mother load of clothes in my size that someone has  recently donated.</p>
<p>I wear coordinating colors most of the time instead of being all  matchity-matchity.  I tend to stick to jewel toned colors so that I know  that the things I purchase will go together.  I also know what clothes  look good on me and what clothes to stay away from; although from time  to time I will try something that I am sure won&#8217;t flatter my shape only  to be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my next point, make sure you can try on your clothes.  Most thrift shops have some sort of dressing room and if they don&#8217;t you  can always wear a long skirt, a cami, and find a quiet corner in the  store with your potential purchases and try on stuff quick.</p>
<p>Learn your thrift stores and resale shops in your area and pop in  whenever you have a chance.  There are three in particular that are  close to me and whenever I am out that way and have an extra few minutes  I will stop in and peruse, especially on their discount days.</p>
<p>Now that you have your finds, make sure you inspect them throughly.   Check hems, zippers, look for stains and snags; while the item in  question may seem perfect in the store, when you get it home it may have  some glaring defect that will cause you to toss it in the trash.  An  extra few minutes before you check out can save you lots of heartache  later.</p>
<p><em><strong>So, do you frequent thrift stores and resale shops? What purchase has made you extra giddy?</strong></em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>By Rebecca Keenan from <a href="http://playgroundconfidential.com/" target="_blank">Playground Confidential</a></strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/02/istock_000016748860xsmall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-536" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/02/istock_000016748860xsmall-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="166" /></a>There are many reasons to cloth diaper a baby. There&#8217;s the environmental impact and the feeling of soft cotton against your baby&#8217;s skin. Cloth diapers will make it easier for your baby to feel wet and might facilitate easier toilet training. Or maybe you have a deep, subconscious yearning to fold squares of cloth just so, fostered by years of setting napkins out in fine dining restaurants. <em>Ahem</em>. But I digress.</p>
<p><span id="more-535"></span>But the number one reason for cloth diapering a baby is &#8230; <em>drumroll</em> &#8230; to save money. This isn&#8217;t entirely a given, however. Cloth diaper companies, no matter how what their eco cred, are out to make a profit and it&#8217;s easy to spend more on cloth diapers than you would have on disposables. I&#8217;ve seen estimates on the cost of using disposable diapers that are way out of line with what people actually spend. I can promise you I didn&#8217;t spend $3000 diapering my second kid &#8212; not even close. Using generic brand diapers and keeping an eye on sales, most people can get away with spending no more than $30 a month on disposables. That&#8217;s $1080 over three years. That&#8217;s the number you have to keep in mind when you&#8217;re purchasing cloth diapers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to get away with spending way, <em>way</em> less than that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look for hand-me-downs</strong>: Someone you know may be more than happy to give you some of their old cloth-diapering stash or to let you use some diapers while they&#8217;re between babies. I was loaned a few wrap-style covers six years ago when my first baby was born and am using them now for the third time. (I swear I&#8217;m giving them back!)</li>
<li><strong>Buy used</strong>: I know this sounds gross at first, but guess what? As soon as your baby pees and poos in a diaper, it&#8217;s used anyway. They are designed to be washed thoroughly, sanitized and to last for a long time. Barely-used diapers are very easy to find, too.</li>
<li><strong>Flats and prefolds are your friends</strong>: There are all manner of fancy fitted and all-in-one diapers on the market, and if you get some handed down or find some used ones cheap, that&#8217;s great. But prefolds are easily folded or pinned into any cover, clean better, last longer and cost less. Old fashioned flats (like the kind your grandmother would have used) are even cheaper. With a bit of practice they can be folded in various ways (Google it!) or doubled up to fit any age baby almost as well as any fitted. They&#8217;re thin enough to line dry quickly and only take ten minutes in the dryer. I love them.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t try to buy three years worth at once</strong>: All of those barely-used cloth diapers on Craigslist and Kijiji? They&#8217;re there because cloth diapering doesn&#8217;t work for everyone. Or maybe it only worked for a few months. Or maybe they had more than they needed or they didn&#8217;t like those particular diapers. Start with the basics and go from there. You can always buy more if and when you need them.</li>
<li><strong>You don&#8217;t need as many as you think</strong>: I&#8217;m personally rocking a meager two dozen diapers right now with five PUL covers (and a stash of larger covers and prefolds to dip into if I run out). This means I do a load of diapers every two or three days. It also means I do a load of something else while I&#8217;m at it and I&#8217;ve never been more caught up on the laundry! It takes no time to dry and fold my diapers and they never get too gross waiting to get laundered. You may want to be able to go a couple more days in between washing and that&#8217;s fine. But you don&#8217;t need to.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Do you have any cloth diapering tips?</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/01/istock_000002744551xsmall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-534" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2012/01/istock_000002744551xsmall-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="165" /></a>Back when I was on maternity leave, and then working from home, getting good (and good for you) meals on the table was pretty simple. I was here at some point in the day, if not all day long, so I had time to prepare and cooks meals, and even dash to the grocery store for any last-minute ingredients. Now that I am working outside of the house full-time, as is my husband, we had to overhaul our meal-planning strategy.</p>
<p><span id="more-533"></span><strong>1. Plan out your meals for the week.</strong> I sit down on the weekend, map out the meals, and do a big grocery shop. The meal plan is written on a chalkboard in our kitchen so that everyone knows the plan, and I stop at the grocery store mid-week to stock up on milk, fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p><strong>2. Invest in/use your slow cooker.</strong> There&#8217;s nothing quite as simple as walking in the door after a long day of work, only to have to set the table and dish out the stew/chili/roast/soup/lasagna/whatever you fancy.</p>
<p><strong>3. Learn how to pre-program your oven.</strong> We will use this for casserole, or if my husband comes home for lunch he&#8217;ll set it for a roasting chicken.</p>
<p><strong>4. Prep as much as you can on the weekend or the night before.</strong> Marinating meats for the barbecue in large batches and then freezing them for future use is a great help. Or marinate them the night before and refrigerate them until you get home. Washing and chopping up vegetables in advance not only makes dinner prep faster, it keeps healthy snacks in check.</p>
<p><strong>5. Take a night off with no guilt.</strong> Whether it&#8217;s a planned weekly night of pizza, or you&#8217;ve had a particularly rough day at work, treating yourself to take-out, healthy or not, can do wonders to recharge your batteries.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any tips for getting a decent dinner on the table during the week?</strong></em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>By Annette Kiesow from <a href="http://catnipandcoffee.com/" target="_blank">Catnip and Coffee</a></em></strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/problemsolved/files/2011/12/istock_000006353817xsmall.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="162" />So you finally got that big freelance gig you’ve been searching for? The first contract work that gives you a chance to start your business, work for yourself, even quit your day job? You’ve spent weeks, months, maybe years putting all of your effort into finding a paying client. Now, you have to spend that same effort, or more, on keeping that client.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing contract work for almost seven years now, and in that time I’ve learned a few things about making clients happy. Happy clients mean more work coming your way, and we all want that! Not only will they keep giving you new assignments but also, continuously working with them will build your reputation in your field so other clients will notice you and, hopefully, hire you.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to help you build your business, and stay in business.</p>
<p><span id="more-525"></span></p>
<p><strong>Meet your deadlines.</strong></p>
<p>This is a big one; never, ever, miss a deadline. Remember, there is always someone on the other end who is waiting for your work to come in so they can do their part. If you are late, then they have to scramble. It might not be someone who does the hiring, but they can still bad mouth you to the boss. I make a point to submit my work early and my clients are always thrilled to have the extra time. When I schedule my deadlines on my calendar, I just bump them up by a day. It’s not easy get on an early schedule, but once you’re there it’s not hard to keep to it.</p>
<p><strong>Get organized and keep records of everything you do. </strong></p>
<p>Whether you have a big paper trail, or work solely on the computer, be sure you can put your hands on any file at any time. This goes for current projects as well as old. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a client say something to the effect of; “Hey remember that project we did 2 years ago, do you know the email address for that photographer we used?” Yep, because I have a dedicated external hard drive that I save everything work related on and can access immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Be available during business hours if at all possible and respond to emails quickly. </strong></p>
<p>We all know many of us are freelancing so we can be home with our kids and that means school pickups, doctor’s appointments, and all of those other things that keep us running. Be mindful though, our clients are often in the office from 8-5 everyday and expect you to be around when they need a question answered quickly. If you respond to queries super fast most of the time, they’ll give you a pass on the few occasions you have to deal with your kid’s ear infection or parent teacher conferences first.</p>
<p><strong>Have the necessary equipment it takes to get the job done right. </strong></p>
<p>That might mean just a laptop and high speed Internet. Or you might be like me and need the works: photocopier, fax machine, (yes some people still use them!) and filing cabinets. If you’re using your cell phone for all of your work calls, ask your friends how well you sound. If it’s not great, well, get a landline. There’s nothing worse for your reputation than being that person on the conference call with the crackly, cutting out cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>Last, but absolutely not least, be an expert. </strong></p>
<p>You’re marketing yourself as qualified and experienced, and they will expect no less. If you get into project and realize you don’t know enough about what you are working on, you need to figure it out, and fast. You’ve been hired to do a job they either don’t have time or knowledge to do themselves. I recently photo edited a book about rocks and minerals, a subject I knew nothing about. I did tons of research to make sure the geologist author would not find any fault with the photos I submitted. That meant a little more time spent on the project, but the payoff was huge when he commended my work on a call with all of the team members, including those who make hiring decisions.</p>
<p>The main point this comes down to is be respectful of your clients, of their time, and their money. Do the best job you can and they will take notice. Creating your own business from scratch isn’t always easy, and getting enough work to sustain it can take some time, but it really can be done and it’s totally worth it.</p>

<p>A friend of mine posted a picture of a quote awhile back that sums it up wonderfully: “A perfect parent is a person with excellent child rearing theories, and no actual children.” True story, right? Whether you have 1, 2 or 25 kids, you know that the perfect parent doesn’t exist. She is the myth that keeps mothers up at night, leaves fathers feeling inadequate and is the thing that sells millions and millions of parenting books each year.</p>
<p>At least, the universal “Perfect Parent” for every kid doesn’t exist. There is however there is a “Perfect Parent” for your kids, and I think you’re going to find (if you don’t already know it), that it’s you!</p>
<p><span id="more-526"></span><strong>1. The Perfect Parent loves her children. Period. </strong>The perfect parent loves her kids whether they are snuggling on the couch or wailing in time out, when she’s laughing with them and when she’s crying over them, when they’re cleaning their toys and when she’s silently counting down the minutes till bedtime. You don’t have to always like their behavior to love them. It doesn’t have to be all Mary Poppins every moment of the day because you love them, you know you do. And so do they! It’s in your hugs and kisses, in bedtime stories and clean laundry. It’s in time outs and “eat your dinners!” Loving your kids is the easiest and sometimes the hardest part of this job called parenting, but it never changes, and it won’t ever go away.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Perfect Parent knows all about broccoli, spinach, spiderman or Dora.</strong> She knows the things that make her kids tick and those that don’t. She remembers that kid #1 LOVES to eat her hotdog with plain bun and ketchup to dip it in, while kid #2 needs a puddle of Ranch dressing for the dipping of everything. She knows that Spiderman is also Peter Parker and that Boots is a monkey, not just footwear. She knows the things that matter, the ones that don’t and everything in between. It’s in that remembering that her children feel loved, they feel important and they feel respected.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Perfect Parent lets her kids see her fall.</strong> If you’ve ever shouted over spilled milk, locked yourself in the bathroom just to breath (or pee alone!) or said something you regret you’ve just given your children a gift. It’s in your imperfection (and often the time it takes to apologize to them later about it – which I believe is KEY) that they see the real. They see that it’s ok to make mistakes, because even mommies make mistakes. Kids spend a good majority of their childhood making mistakes and learning from them, sometimes it makes them feel like failures. But when they see you fall and get back up again, they have hope. They see that mistakes are forgiven and that the world didn’t end, and maybe that means they’re not failures after all. Maybe that means they’re “perfect” too! dinner or staying up past bedtime, the perfect parent trades in the rules for fun once in a while. Sometimes it’s in those broken or forgotten rules that we make the biggest memories, teach the deepest lessons and a laugh till we cry. It’s also when we find the good after a long hard day and where WE find the strength to face whatever tomorrow’s going to bring.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Perfect Parent sometimes forgets the rules.</strong> Whether it’s ice cream for dinner or staying up past bedtime, the perfect parent trades in the rules for fun once in a while. Sometimes it’s in those broken or forgotten rules that we make the biggest memories, teach the deepest lessons and a laugh till we cry. It’s also when we find the good after a long hard day and where WE find the strength to face whatever tomorrow’s going to bring.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Perfect Parent knows that she’s got no idea what she’s doing</strong>. But she gets up each and every day to do her best. She’ll tell you that she’s winging this parenting gig, she has no secrets or magic keys, she fails more than she succeeds some days and she aches to do better. But she’ll also tell you her children are happy, they are loved, they are cherished, they are safe and they are hers. She’ll tell you that no matter what you see on TV, or read in a magazine, or find on the internet, nobody has all the answers. Then she’ll tell you that, that’s ok. She doesn’t need all the answers, she just needs her kids, she needs their hugs and their love, their kisses and their giggles, their smelly farts and their “Buy WHY?”s because that’s what makes her the perfect parent, the perfect kids for her.<br />
