		<description>There's the For the Kids album, it has a lot of different people (Cake, Wilco, Sarah McLachlan) doing Mahna Mahna, and Rainbow Connection and the like.  

Then there's the School House Rock! Rocks with Ween, the Lemonheads, and Biz Markie doing Three is the Magic Number, and My Hero, Zero and such.</description>

		<description>Funky Mama is our favorite children's music by far.  We have all of her CDs, and we all know every word.  I may or may not be known to listen to her when the kids aren't in the car....</description>

		<description>My children always had very eclectic tastes. Joni Mitchell had a children's bedtime album that both kids loved. Tom Pease, a Midwestern singer/entertainer, has several excellent albums out. He's even better live.</description>

		<description>Oh, also a lesser known but oh, so worth it children's artist....Graham Clarke!  You can see his stuff at www.grahamclarke.com.  He is primarily known in my area but his CDs are fabulous and funny and are loved by parents as much as by kids.</description>

		<description>I highly recommend DADDIES SING GOODNIGHT (you can get it on Amazon).  It is lullaby music all sung by men to their children.  My T H I R T E E N year old son has listened to this EVERY SINGLE NIGHT of his life since he was 10 months old.  My 8 year old daughter also listens to it each night.  We have dueling iPod docking stations!</description>

		<description>After my son was born, I wanted to stay home to raise him. If was so hard to shrink budget and life style of 2 incomes to one. We kept accumulating more and more debt. I knew I had to something. I wanted to work from my house, so I can be with my baby, but also help my husband financially.
It wasn’t easy to land true opportunity. There is a lot of fraud out there. I tried to get into stuffing envelopes, filling out surveys, secret shopper.... Nothing legit....until...
Now I have my home business and I am part of this great company! The most important thing is that I work from home and am with my family. With great support and online training, I got everything I needed to achieve my financial goals and dreams with this proven business model.

		<description>We lso like They Might Be Giants. IMO Here Come The ABC's better than the No album. My fave songs: E eats Everything, Clap Your Hands and Alphabet of Nations.
I have not heard the new Numbers album yet.</description>

		<description>Yep - we also have "No!" and love it.  We have 'Here Come the ABCs' too, and it's pretty good. Haven't heard the '123s' yet.
Thanks for this - gives me some more ideas!</description>
