They are launching 6 New York Times best selling titles (including 50 Shades of Grey) in ALL Target stores this summer. Livrada gift cards are a more personal gift for any e-reader in your life.

Last week, in fact, he went hunting with his brother and they bagged a bear. All he has to show of this momentous occasion (apart from the bear sausage) is a few blurry phone photos. A hunting buddy told him that he needs to get a decent point-and-shoot. I agree, and had wanted to get him one for his birthday, but he had turned it down. Now that I get to buy him one (I&#8217;m the photographer in the family), I think we&#8217;re going to go with the Powershot SX 260.</p>

<p>For comparison: Amazon currently has the same bundle <A href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TFOPJA/?tag=wantnot-20" title="This is an affiliate link." target="_blank">for $24.95</a>, so this is about a 30% savings as well as free shipping (tricksy Amazon kept it under $25 so that you&#8217;d have to have Prime for the free shipping). </p>
<p>Reviews are plentiful and largely positive, so if bikes are taking over your space, this is a great deal.</p>
