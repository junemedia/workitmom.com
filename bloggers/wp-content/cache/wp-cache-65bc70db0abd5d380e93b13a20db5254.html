			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1144" style="float: left;margin: 10px" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/workitmom/files/2012/05/breath-stickie-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />Earlier today we went on a picnic with some friends of ours. The sun was shining, it was finally warm like May warm should be, and we were sitting in a beautiful park with enough food, wine and conversation to keep us happy for hours. Our daughters are all similar in age which made for lots of fun giggling and running around, giving us some much needed time to catch up with our friends. It was awesome (and I&#8217;m proud to say that my phone stayed in my bag most of the time.)</p>
<p>When we got home my husband told me that this was the first time, in a very long time, that he saw me sitting down anywhere for more than a few minutes (long car rides excluded.) He told me that he looked over at me sitting on the grass next to my friend and it struck him that he almost never sees me sitting still.</p>
<p>You know what? He is absolutely right. If you exclude the times when I am working at my computer or sitting in the car, I can&#8217;t say I sit very much. Of course I sit down to eat but I wouldn&#8217;t count that as sitting still. I think what he meant is sitting still like you would if you were watching TV or reading or just chillaxing.<span id="more-1143"></span></p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t do very much of that. My life is in constant motion, usually at fever speed, and the only time I really stop moving is when I go to sleep (and sadly not for very long). Besides the fact that this probably isn&#8217;t a good idea long-term, I also don&#8217;t want to be setting an example for my daughter that resting isn&#8217;t a good thing to do. The other day we were talking about wishes we would ask a genie to grant us and one of hers was &#8220;a machine that would do all the cooking, organizing and working so that mama can take a rest.&#8221; I am insanely touched that she would use her wish to give me more rest but I also want to make sure that she knows that while juggling work, family and a bunch of other stuff is challenging, that it&#8217;s OK to take a break from time to time and sit still.</p>
<p><strong>Do you make time to chill out and be still?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1142" style="float: left;margin: 10px" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/workitmom/files/2012/05/momhugsdaughter-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />And here it is:</p>
<p>I want to feel like an awesome mom.</p>
<p>For this Mother&#8217;s Day, my kiddo and husband are plotting something and I think they are planning to make me breakfast. I will love that, not the least because I do 99% of the cooking at home and I do gripe about how nice it would be to be served some food. We are also doing a dinner together with all the grandmas and it&#8217;s one of my favorite meals we have as a family &#8212; I love celebrating all the moms.</p>
<p>But what I really really want is to feel like I am a rockin mom and that&#8217;s something that I need to feel from the inside. My biggest struggle as a working mom is that I constantly feel like I&#8217;m not doing a great job: as a mom, at work, as a wife, friend, daughter. Last night stuff at work was blowing up and I needed to answer some emails while helping kiddo do homework and practice piano. I could see her looking over at me and I hated that I was on my phone, but at the time that was what I needed to do. But you can bet I didn&#8217;t go to bed feeling like an awesome mom. (Of course I know she will be OK and we will make up the time together and life is life and not perfect. But it doesn&#8217;t make it easier.)<span id="more-1141"></span></p>
<p>When I talk to my working mom friends this comes up a lot, in fact, more then the guilt discussion. They feel torn in lots of directions and they don&#8217;t feel good about themselves. I am sure moms who don&#8217;t work have similar issues just with different circumstances. In fact, the other day one of my friends, who is a stay-at-home mom, told me that she feels like she should be doing a lot more with her son than she is, things like outings and creative projects. We all have high expectations of ourselves, it seems, and maybe that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to feel like we are rocking in.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my Mother&#8217;s Day wish for myself: To give myself a break and to appreciate that I love my kiddo and I do my best to be the most rockin mom I can.</p>
<p><strong>Have you found a way to not be hard on yourself or are you in my camp? Share your thoughts in the comments and have an awesome Mother&#8217;s Day!</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/workitmom/files/2012/04/woman-typing.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1140" style="float: left;margin: 10px" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/workitmom/files/2012/04/woman-typing-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>If you have total control over your email and it doesn&#8217;t stress you out, please stop reading now. For the rest of you, fellow overwhelmed-by-email readers, this will sound familiar:</p>
<p>I am in a constant struggle with my email.</p>
<p>There is too much of it. I feel overwhelmed by it most of the time, and just barely in control of it on the best days. I spend too much of my day answering and reading email and while I know it&#8217;s something that I have to do &#8212; for work and for life &#8212; it&#8217;s not something that makes me feel good or productive enough.</p>
<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve tried to develop email habits that will help me tame the animal. Here are a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t check email first thing in the morning</strong>. This is my favorite one. When I manage to stick to it, I am more productive, my day goes better, and I am much more focused.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check email at set times throughout the day.</strong> My worst email days are those when I leave my inbox open throughout the day. Then I can&#8217;t avoid the temptation of checking new mail when I see I have some and it just completely kills my productivity.<span id="more-1139"></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have a process for going through your inbox.</strong> The first thing I do is clear out spam or the too-numerous emails from the various places I&#8217;ve shopped online. My second step is to skim through content emails - those that I would just read, like newsletters from sites I&#8217;m interested in - to see if I want to read any of them. I delete all others and leave the few to read later. (I leave them in my inbox while I&#8217;ve also seen advice to put them in a separate Read folder). Third, I go through and reply to emails that require a quick response. I leave emails that require more work for later and try to have one dedicated time a day when I respond to them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take an email hiatus. </strong>I&#8217;ve only done this once, when I went on vacation for 5 days and literally didn&#8217;t check my email once. I had an outgoing message on my personal email as well as my work email to let people know and I set my own expectations accordingly. I literally made myself take a mental email break and it was awesome. A friend of mine has taken a hiatus like this before but went a step further. His auto-reply to anyone who sent him email during it was to let them know that he would be deleting all email for a week of his hiatus. If it was important, he asked people to resend it. He said it worked amazingly well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Few other recent pieces of advice around email that I&#8217;ve read and found useful are from <a href="http://zenhabits.net/email-zen-clear-out-your-inbox/">Zen Habits</a> and <a href="http://www.bostonmamas.com/2012/04/minimizing_e-mail_3-touch_rule.html#more">Boston Mamas</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Do you struggle with email? What are your favorite ways of taming the email monster?</strong></p>

Woohoo! (And also OMG, all of us really needed this one. A lot.) I&#8217;ve packed the bags, cleaned up the house so it&#8217;s not a total disaster when we get back, and gotten our documents and tickets ready. And now for the big important question:</p>
<p>Should I bring my laptop?</p>
<p>My initial answer was absolutely not. It&#8217;s been a crazy few months and I really need a break. My brain needs to disconnect and I need to spend time worrying about whether we all have enough sunscreen on instead of checking emails. Out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is something to be said for being able to check email once a day (and I truly would only limit myself to once a day) and not having a panic attack when I&#8217;m back and there is a mountain of emails here to greet me. I&#8217;ve done this once before on vacation and thought it worked well. It also prevented me from stressing about the crises I didn&#8217;t know about because well, if they happened, I would know about them. Out of sight doesn&#8217;t always mean out of mind.</p>
<p>My husband suggested that I don&#8217;t bring a laptop but instead go to the business center at the hotel to check email if I absolutely can&#8217;t resist the urge to do it. (We&#8217;re traveling abroad so checking it on my phone is not an option. Otherwise I think that&#8217;s what I would do.) I&#8217;m considering this idea.</p>
<p><strong>But tell me, when you go on vacation, do you disconnect entirely or do you check your work or personal emails from time to time? </strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1136" style="float: left;margin: 5px" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/workitmom/files/2012/04/family-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />My daughter asked to have a playdate with a girl from her class recently so I emailed her mom to see whether one of the next Sundays would work. She kindly replied that weekends are family time for them and asked if we could do the playdate during the week. Thing is, during the week our kiddo has activities on most days and weekends are when playdates work best for us, especially because my husband and I both work. (Our babysitter could bring her to a playdate after school one day but because she is only here three days a week she prefers that they do stuff together instead or she helps her with her homework.)</p>
<p>So this got me thinking about the weekend life juggle between family time and friend time. Starting with our <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workitmom/2012/03/16/work-life-juggling-tip-make-more-traditions/">Friday night sushi and movie night tradition</a>, weekends are when my husband, kiddo and I have time to spend together. A lot of times we&#8217;re definitely guilty of trying to fit too much in, but the main ingredient is us hanging out together. Once in a while we succeed at leaving an afternoon open, and as unexciting as this sounds, one of my favorite times is when the three of us just hang out at home together, without rushing off to another activity, however fun it might be.<span id="more-1135"></span></p>
<p>But I know my daughter likes to have playdates so I try to arrange them for her during the weekends. If scheduling stars align she has a playdate while I get some cooking done on Sunday afternoons, and then we&#8217;re all back for dinner together as a family. Lately I&#8217;ve also started to take her and a friend somewhere for a few hours &#8212; to see a movie or make necklaces together. This way she and I are together and she gets to have a friend there as well.</p>
<p>I know there is no perfect solution and I know moms who stay at home and those who work all face similar scheduling challenges. I&#8217;m curious how you guys do it in your family: <strong>Do you designate one day on the weekend as family day and don&#8217;t schedule any playdates or other activities? Or do you just fit things in around each other?</strong></p>

<p>There was a lot of phone calls, emails, Twitter browsing, and looking over my to-do list, but it&#8217;s not far from the truth to say I wasted a bunch of time. I hate this feeling. If you&#8217;ve had it you know what I mean. So this blog post is part of my strategy for dealing with it. Because the way I see it, I could either call this a day (which I think would be a mistake, although not always, just today) or try to get some stuff done and quick.</p>
<p>Starting as soon as I hit publish, here&#8217;s my plan for coming out of the productivity rut:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn off my Wi-Fi</strong>. It&#8217;s maybe the oldest trick in the book but I rarely make myself do it. Without email, Twitter, Facebook, NY Times and other distractions, I know I will get more done. Or at least something done.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take a tea break</strong>. I think there needs to be a physical reset from wasting time to being productive. Since I can&#8217;t change where I am right now I am going to take a mini break and make some tea. And drink it. <span id="more-1133"></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Put away my to-do list</strong>. It&#8217;s sitting here and scaring me. Truly. I know a ton of stuff I need to do and don&#8217;t need to be reminded right this second.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get something done right this very second.</strong> I&#8217;m going to cheat a little and say that writing this blog post is a to-do that I&#8217;m getting done. It is, of course, but I&#8217;m only going to count it half way. So as soon as I&#8217;m done I am diving into the world of spreadsheets because one of my unpleasant-but-must-get-done to-dos is hiding in there.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, wish me luck. <strong>More importantly, share your tips for climbing out of a productivity rut in the comments!</strong></p>

And yet, it&#8217;s one of the things that consistently gets squeezed out of the otherwise insane work-family-stuff-I-have-to-do schedule. Every time I catch up with a friend I reminder myself to make that a priority, and yet, it&#8217;s still a challenge.</p>
<p>All of my friends have busy lives of their own so it&#8217;s understandable that it&#8217;s tough to align two (or more) schedules and find time to hang out together. It&#8217;s definitely not for lack of trying: I have strings of text messages and emails with friends where we&#8217;re attempting to get together only to be derailed by a work meeting, almost-forgotten playdate, a business trip, or something else. Still, this doesn&#8217;t help the fact that I love spending time with friends and I have too little of it to spend with them.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I realized there were a few somewhat creative things I&#8217;ve done recently to make more time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Joint errand running</strong>. OK, so this is much less fun than say getting dinner at one of our favorite places, but a friend and I recently spent a few hours running errands together. We stopped for some frozen yogurt in between and had time to catch up walking around and in the car.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-bedtime quick drink</strong>. Going out to dinner at 9pm on a weeknight is a no-go, but my friend and I recently decided to go grab a quick drink after we put our kids to bed (with both of our husbands staying home with the kiddos). It was just an hour or so but completely worth it.<span id="more-1131"></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business catch up &amp; playdate.</strong> One of my friends just started a new job and wanted to talk about a few work-related things. We could find no time to meet during the week and didn&#8217;t want to take time away from being with our kids on the weekends. So he came over with his daughter, who had quite a nice time playing with mine, while he and I caught up on all stuff work-related.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about you: <strong>Are you able to make enough time to spend with friends? Do you have any creative ideas to share to make it work more often for the rest of us trying to juggle a million things? Please share!</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1130" style="float: left;margin: 10px" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/workitmom/files/2012/03/familywalking-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />I&#8217;m a big proponent of the quality over quantity time argument: I think the quality of time you spend with your kids and family is more important than the quantity. When I put my phone away, stop multi-tasking and really engage with my kiddo and my husband, it&#8217;s awesome. The key ingredient in quality time is being there mentally, 100% (which is hard to do when I&#8217;m endlessly being distracted with incoming work emails on my phone.)</p>
<p>One of the best ways I&#8217;ve found to add quality time to our crazy busy hectic life is by setting up family traditions. It really helps to have some regular times and things we do as a family that we can all look forward to and that are non-negotiable. (Well, I&#8217;m being idealistic. We&#8217;ve skipped many a tradition because of schedules or because we simply forgot or were too tired. But the intention is there.)</p>
<p>Here are a few of our favorite ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family movie night.</strong> Every Friday we eat dinner together and then watch a movie. It&#8217;s my favorite part of the week and I look forward to it all day Friday. By the end of the week I&#8217;m wiped and I think my husband is too. It&#8217;s awesome to know that we have this completely relaxing family chill-out time waiting there for us.<span id="more-1129"></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunday morning in-bed Sudoku.</strong> Sunday mornings our daughter comes into our room around 8 (yes, she hangs out in her room until then, lucky us!) and plays Sudoku on the iPad while we get to not jump out of bed like we do during the week and sort of all chill out together. It usually turns into a family Sudoku solving situation, which is awesome.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Living room dance party. </strong>We don&#8217;t have a regular set time for this but at least a few times a week my daughter and I break out into a crazy dance party in the living room. (Confession: Britney Spears is a frequent guest performer.) Truly the best five minutes of the day when we do this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are your favorite family traditions or mini-traditions?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The title of this post is an actual quote my 7 year-old kiddo said to someone this weekend.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>To be honest, it kind of stopped me in my tracks. Of course I like the weekends &#8212; who doesn&#8217;t like a break from the work grind and a chance to chill with family? But what struck me is that my kiddo has this notion in her head that I don&#8217;t like to work. Or at least don&#8217;t like to work enough that the reason I like weekends is because I don&#8217;t have to work.</p>
<p>Without getting into yet another stay at home or work debate (which oh, I hope we are done with!), I&#8217;ll say this: I like to work and I&#8217;ve never imagined myself not working. (Well, to be honest, I have imagined myself on a prolonged vacation somewhere warm and tropical, but that&#8217;s another story.) When I read Leah&#8217;s post, <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingonmotherhood/2012/02/15/if-i-won-the-lottery/" target="_blank">about whether she&#8217;d still choose to work if she won the lottery</a>, I was nodding my head. I work for more than money, although money is an important necessity. I work because I love the challenge, building something, creating something, working with awesome people, keeping my brain buzzing and my sanity relatively intact. <span id="more-1128"></span></p>
<p>Sure, my job is stressful and there are bad days and days when I come home and tell my kiddo how tired I am because of work. But I am clearly not communicating to her the positives about working and I need to, because want it or not, we are the first role models our kids have. I do think I am more sensitive to this because I have a daughter and because I am acutely aware that she is going to have to be making some tough choices about family, career, and some kind of juggling arrangement that works for her. I want to do my best in sharing my experiences with her and I think being honest is really important, but I think I&#8217;ve been over-sharing on the &#8220;OMG I am so tired from work!&#8221; front and under-sharing on the &#8220;OMG this awesome thing happened at work!&#8221; front.</p>
<p><strong>In general, do you find that you complain about work or being tired from work to your kids? Or are you pretty balanced in sharing the good stuff too?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1127" style="float: left;margin: 10px" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/workitmom/files/2012/02/girldonuts-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />OK, so first a confession:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a bit of a healthy eating nut and I think it is a skill and a philosophy I have to teach our kiddo.</p>
<p>When I say healthy eating I think I mean something reasonable without being extreme: Lots of veggies and fruit, less sugar and white anything, whole grains, very little red meat, lots of fish, nuts and other awesome stuff, like avocados (an obsession of mine and thankfully, my daughter). We don&#8217;t have junk food or candy in our house, don&#8217;t drink soda or sugary drinks, and our daughter has never been to McDonald&#8217;s. But we definitely have dessert and treats a few times a week and one of the most important things I try to teach at home is enjoying eating and food and making it a special experience as often as we can.</p>
<p>The other day our kiddo came home from a playdate and I asked her how it went. She said fine and then got this look on her face that said &#8220;hey, mom, I&#8217;m not telling you something.&#8221; I gave her my best version of the &#8220;hey, it&#8217;s OK, just tell me, I promise I won&#8217;t be mad&#8221; look and then she confessed: They ate pop tarts. And candy.</p>
<p>I think she expected me to get upset. But I wasn&#8217;t.<span id="more-1125"></span> I mean, I&#8217;d rather she not consume all that sugar but it&#8217;s not my house and I firmly believe in &#8220;your house, your rules&#8221; philosophy.</p>
<p>I smiled and asked her if she liked the candy. She put on a huge grin and said &#8220;Yes&#8230; but I know all that stuff is bad for me.&#8221; Yes, I&#8217;ll confess it was at least nice to hear.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my worry: That because I emphasize healthy food at home and limit junk that she will then find ways to overdose on it when I&#8217;m not around. If this sounds silly, I&#8217;ll tell you a little story. My husband grew up in a macrobiotic family &#8212; their food makes mine look unhealthy. Any chance he had he snuck away to friends&#8217; houses to eat as much sugar and crap as possible. To this day (and we&#8217;re talking 25+ years later!) he has a serious sweet tooth and when he gets a chance, overindulges in stuff we don&#8217;t eat a lot at home.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I know that all I can do is teach my kiddo the best eating habits I can and hope for the best. <strong>But I am curious, how do you think about food and eating habits in your family?<br />
</strong></p>
