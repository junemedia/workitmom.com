		<description>Angela- Next post:  "Are you and my step-daughter the same person?"  "No."  That is so funny:  wouldn't it be weird if your step-daughter and I were &lt;i&gt;actually related&lt;/i&gt; and we just didn't realize it?  Ask her if she has any relatives named Kristen!</description>

		<description>If it's possible, you look cuter in each successive photo...

Also?  You do NOT look fifty-five, you have an awesome jawline in all the photos and I LOVE to see the extra, less-perfect shots, as you look like someone with whom I would TOTALLY have tea and chocolate-dipped things.

And also, also?  I KNEW that you would have great teeth!!</description>

		<description>LOVE THIS! Yay! I will call you Swistle forev!

The other photos of you cracked me right up. I thought you looked lovely in all of them, but your comments about yourself were hilarious. 

I really reeeeally need to know your skin secrets. I am 31 and break out like a teenager. It's embarrassing.</description>

		<description>You look EXACTLY like my step-daughter.  I am thisclose to calling the FBI and having your DNA tested to make sure you aren't a time-warped pandora's box version of her.  Wait.  Did you come back in time to kill your step-mom?  I guess that wouldn't cause any problems for you, so far as your existence goes.  Being that I'm not your grandfather or related to you by blood in any way.  Can I panic now?</description>

		<description>I am 28 and you look younger than me in all of those photos. And I am single and childless. Just so you know.</description>

		<description>I swear to God, I'm laughing my ASS off over here. For starters, it is not the saggy folds you claim to have, for honestly, you still look great. It's your resigned super-professional expression that screams Hillary Clinton. That's totally a politician's head shot -- or maybe a lawyer. You're all, yes, I am here for the flight to Bosnia, where are the rockets and sniper fire, please? I'm ready, sir!

Also worth noting: If you'd posted that first photo in the bunch, I NEVER would have chosen it and would have been lost and disoriented. My version of Swistle never wanted to be President.</description>

		<description>I'm so excited by all the photos of YOU!  I love having a face with a name (which will ALWAYS be Swistle).</description>
