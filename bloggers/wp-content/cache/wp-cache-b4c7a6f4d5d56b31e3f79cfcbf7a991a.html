		<description>It's not just about how you look.  It's about how you think about yourself, even when there is no-one else there to see you.  If you dress with a bit of style, you are more likely to think of yourself as go-getting entrepreneur.  That state of mind helps, particularly if you run your business from a kitchen table with a pile of unwashed baby clothes weighing on your conscience!</description>

		<description>Ooh.. 

I work in a call center that doesn't have a strict dress code. This of course means that I see more than my fair share of velour track suits throughout my week. My one thing is even if I dont' want to shower in the morning, I must wear structured pants and cannot wear a t-shirt. I have worn jeans and an underarmour top before, but it looks put together.</description>

		<description>Oh, I keep meaning to look into those Chicos pants.  As a yoga teacher I have more yoga pants than I ever thought I would have.  I love each of them and my favorites for actually doing yoga have a drawstring so there is no droopage (today this is a word) in the back when I'm bending and twisting.  So at least 2 times a week I walk out of my house in these pants.

That being said, I REFUSE to wear them around the house unless I am doing actual exercise.  I work from home and have made a huge effort to get in a shower every morning and put on jeans (dark and the right fit, of course) or a skirt even if no one but the kids will be seeing me.  It makes me feel better and more productive.  Long skirts make playing on the floor easy and help me feel feminine.  Um, but as I type this, I have yet to take that shower and I can hear the world outside the house wide awake and dressed.</description>

		<description>When I am feeling the need for yoga-pants comfort, but a more put-together look, I go for my Travelers collection pants from Chicos.  They are just as comfy, but can be dressed up more with the right top and jewelry.  I have a few different styles and they have lasted forever.</description>
