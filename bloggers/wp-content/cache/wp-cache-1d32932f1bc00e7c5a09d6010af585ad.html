			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>(Again, I hope you will excuse the sudden&#8212;and I hope temporary&#8212;appearance of the automated double-underlined ad links. I&#8217;m not planting them; they&#8217;re just springing up.)</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://swistle.blogspot.com"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2211" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/07/birthday-220x198.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="198" /></a></p>
<p>The twins turned seven, and for me it meant not just &#8220;O MY BABIES ARE GROWING UP&#8221; but also &#8220;O MAN THIS IS A LOT OF PRESENT IDEAS TO COME UP WITH.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JBNQ/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2212" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/07/calculator-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>One of the more surprising successes was a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JBNQ/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">calculator</a> (photo from Amazon.com) for Edward. He&#8217;d kept stealing mine, so I wondered if he might like to have one of his own&#8212;and although his first reaction was not quite the level of THRILL a person might be looking for in a birthday gift reaction, he&#8217;s played with it nearly every day since.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.littlemissmatched.com/Catalog/Buy-3-Get-1-Free-Anklets/Zany_White_Tossed_Anklet_Socks"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2213" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/07/missmatched-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>My parents bought <a href="http://www.littlemissmatched.com/Catalog/Buy-3-Get-1-Free-Anklets/Zany_White_Tossed_Anklet_Socks">LittleMissMatched socks</a> (photo from LittleMissMatched.com) for Elizabeth. I had the fun of choosing, so I chose all from the buy-3-sets-get-1-set-free section, to reduce the pain of paying THREE dollars PER sock PLUS shipping. This was a great gift idea for grandparents, because I KNEW Elizabeth really wanted the socks but I was having a hard time getting over the hurdle of the price (and the SUPER annoyance of not being able to use a free shipping code on an order containing buy-3-get-1). My mom: &#8220;Pish! They&#8217;re perfect! Let&#8217;s order them!&#8221;<span id="more-2210"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006M464Q2/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2214" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/07/magnicube-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>For Edward, my parents bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006M464Q2/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">rainbow Magnicube</a>. I gave them the suggestion even though the magnet-swallowing stories freak me out, because Edward has wanted these for YEARS and I kept saying no no no no because Henry was too young. Now Henry is five and I am just going to live with my vivid fantasies of the children getting emergency x-rays followed by emergency intestinal surgery. (No. Don&#8217;t tell me any more stories. I have heard the stories.) And the Magnicube is a huuuuuuuge hit: daily playing. And, since he wanted the multicolored set, there&#8217;s been lots of pattern practicing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006C0485U/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2215" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/07/penguin-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>This was Elizabeth&#8217;s funniest present: we got her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006C0485U/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">this double-armful-sized stuffed penguin</a> she loved (photo from Amazon.com) plus the SAME penguin in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005QOXTG2/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">regular-stuffed-animal-sized</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IB03UO/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">large-grapefruit-sized</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007P06WF0/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">comically-small-backpack-clip-on-sized</a>. Imagine the four round wrapped presents lined up on the table.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EHQJ2C/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2216" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/07/papermario-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be a holiday if Edward didn&#8217;t want a video game. This time it was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EHQJ2C/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">PaperMario</a> (photo from Amazon.com). I was glad it was one of the $20 ones instead of one of the $40 ones.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QK5TXI/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2217" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/07/owls-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>I think Elizabeth is finally tiring of Sticky Mosaics, but she&#8217;d hoped to get a set for her birthday and so I got her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QK5TXI/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">the owls set</a> (photo from Amazon.com). This one has shaped backgrounds instead of the more typical rectangles, and that&#8217;s been fun for a change.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UNZTUO/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2218" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/07/umbrella-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about &#8220;character&#8221; products, and those feelings are this: (1) I hate the look of them, (2) unless my kids love them, in which case I suddenly love the thrill factor of them. Edward had mentioned fervently that something he REALLY WANTED was his OWN UMBRELLA, and then I saw this Mario one at Target at 50% off, so I bought it. Big success.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>[Please excuse all the sudden double-underline text-link ads. I don't know yet what's up with those, but I have an email in asking about them.]</strong></em></p>
<p>Every summer I like to buy an assortment of fun things and little treats. (Buying things: it&#8217;s how I cope.)</p>
<p><a href='http://www.swistle.blogspot.com'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/hostess-220x206.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="206" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2188" /></a></p>
<p>Our first treat this summer was a selection of Hostess items (Twinkies, cupcakes, Sno-balls, a fruit pie) for cultural literacy. (Verdict: no one liked them as much as they&#8217;d expected to, but it was fun to do/try.) We also tried the York Peppermint Patty ice cream bars (verdict: pretty good) and the Reese&#8217;s Cup ice cream bars (verdict: two kids didn&#8217;t finish theirs and the others thought they were fine; I thought they were VERY YUM and I gladly ate the ones the two kids didn&#8217;t finish).</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009XBY1W/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/scrambledstates-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2184" /></a></p>
<p>Then I bought the game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009XBY1W/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Scrambled States</a> (photo from Amazon.com). William got an &#8220;area of concern&#8221; marking in U.S. geography this past year, so he and I are working together on our geography dislike/difficulty. (My grandfather was a cartographer. You can imagine the pain he felt when, for example, he would ask me if I knew where Egypt was. Me: &#8220;Let&#8217;s see. It&#8217;s not in North America or, like, near England. &#8230;Wait. Right?&#8221;) We&#8217;ve been playing the game for a couple of weeks, and it&#8217;s a really good one. It&#8217;s marked &#8220;8+&#8221; and it&#8217;s definitely perfect for Rob and William (and, er, me), but it&#8217;s easy enough that the 7-year-old twins can play it with us too as long as I keep reassuring them that the rest of us have already LEARNED our states (&#8230;theoretically) so of COURSE we&#8217;re better at it.<span id="more-2183"></span></p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYMX6/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/jumprope-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2185" /></a></p>
<p>Then a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000BYMX6/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">jump rope</a> (photo from Amazon.com). Well, TWO jump ropes, because when I bought the one Elizabeth had asked for, Edward wanted to know why I hadn&#8217;t gotten one for him. &#8230;Well, THREE jump ropes, because then one of the kids left a jump rope in the driveway and I ran over the handle.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000205XI/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/skipbo-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2186" /></a></p>
<p>Last week I ran into some neighbors at the store and they heartily recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000205XI/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Skip-bo</a> (photo from Amazon.com) as a game parents could play with children without wishing for sweet, sweet death (see: Candyland). I bought it on the spot, at that very store. Upsides: I can play it with all five children at once (it&#8217;s for 2-6 players); even 5-year-old Henry can play with some assistance, and I notice it&#8217;s helping him with numbers (sequencing and figuring out how many more cards he needs to make five). Downsides: With six players, everyone was bored waiting for turns, and we barely finished stacks in time to refill the draw pile. A four-, three-, or two-player match works much better&#8212;which is fine, because it turns out that playing a game with all five children is not ideal for my sanity anyway.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BPK2KM/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/07/yellowalbum-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2209" /></a></p>
<p>Every summer for the last few years I&#8217;ve bought a new kid album for the car: we spend kind of a lot of time driving to and fro. This year I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BPK2KM/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">The Yellow Album</a> (photo from Amazon.com), from SpongeBob SquarePants. It&#8217;s better than I&#8217;d expected.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.swistle.blogspot.com'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/mcsimon-220x239.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="239" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2189" /></a></p>
<p>I asked the kids if they could think of anything else fun we&#8217;d gotten this summer, and William said &#8220;THE CAT!&#8221; Okay, we didn&#8217;t on purpose get him as a summer treat, but he HAS worked out that way: there&#8217;s been lots of cooing over the cat, and playing with him, and watching him. Big success, A+++++ would recommend.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>Have you bought any summer treatish things? There is still a lot of summer left.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of my kids (okay, just Elizabeth) like to wear outfits that coordinate with holidays. But it turns out that a shirt that says &#8220;Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day!&#8221; only works one day a year. So my favorite way to handle things is to buy clothing that <em>can be used</em> for the holiday&#8212;but doesn&#8217;t necessarily look holidayish after the day has passed. There are plenty of little-girl clothing items with hearts on them, so if I get heart tights and a shirt with a heart on it and a pink or red skirt, she&#8217;s dressed for the Valentine&#8217;s Day party but can still use those pieces on other days with other clothes.</p>
<p>Same with 4th of July: I like flag shirts TOO, but a &#8220;July 4th 2012!&#8221; flag shirt is not quite as fully wonderful on July 5th. Red shirt + blue skirt + anything with a star or stripe on it = sensible things that can go into regular rotation afterward.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bodenusa.com/en-US/Girls-Tops-T-shirts/31546-RED/Girls-Flame-Dizzy-Daisy-Pretty-T-shirt.html"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2191" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/screen-shot-2012-06-27-at-65550-am-220x223.png" alt="" width="220" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://www.bodenusa.com/en-US/Girls-Tops-T-shirts/31546-RED/Girls-Flame-Dizzy-Daisy-Pretty-T-shirt.html">Boden red/white/blue floral shirt</a> (photo from BodenUSA.com). On July 4th or Memorial Day with other red/white/blue clothes, this is going to look patriotic as heck. On July 5th with jeans, it&#8217;s just a cute summer shirt.<span id="more-2190"></span></p>
<p>Or how about this:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can we talk a little about what we did for Father&#8217;s Day THIS year, so that we can refer to it NEXT year? I&#8217;d wanted to do a post on Father&#8217;s Day gift ideas last week, but I felt too discouraged, and also Paul reads here sometimes and I didn&#8217;t want to give away his gift idea. And of course all the store gift ideas are like &#8220;Barbecue! Golf! Beer! Sports! Tools! Here&#8217;s the perfect idea but it&#8217;s $250!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was lucky this year, because I thought of an idea for something I wanted to get ANYWAY for Paul, and Father&#8217;s Day was only a month or so away so I bought it and put it aside.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BK54RM/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/remotefinder-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2181" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BK54RM/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Wireless Remote Locator</a> (photo from Amazon.com). Paul is continually getting frustrated at not being able to find the remote, and I am continually getting frustrated about the frustrated searching, so this is really a gift for BOTH of us. There is a risk, of course, of losing the remote finder&#8212;but I plan to NAIL IT TO <strike>HIS HAND</strike> THE WALL.<span id="more-2180"></span></p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1932100873/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/boardingenterprise-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2182" /></a></p>
<p>For my own dad, I got a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1932100873/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Boarding the Enterprise: Transporters, Tribbles, and the Vulcan Death Grip</a> (photo from Amazon.com) and a bag of pecan-pie-flavored pecans.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to remember what I&#8217;ve done other years. One year I got Paul a grill, but the gift in that case wasn&#8217;t really the grill (which was a household item we&#8217;d agreed to acquire, and also too expensive for what we do for Mother&#8217;s/Father&#8217;s Day) but rather the handling the research/purchase of it and asking my dad to set it up. (Actually, I think I also had my dad do the research.) (And he might have also been the one to pick it up at the store, now that I think of it.) (BUT I&#8217;M THE ONE WHO ASKED HIM TO.)</p>
<p>Most years for Paul I do my favorite idea, which is to have the kids each choose one treat-like item (candy, gum, chips, nuts). Even with the occasional known misstep (a younger child insists on getting him a certain candy, for example, even when I explain that No, Daddy Doesn&#8217;t Like That Kind, YOU Like That Kind), with five children there&#8217;s bound to be SOME things Paul likes. And it makes a good exercise for the kids: here we are in the candy aisle, but we are NOT THINKING OF OURSELVES. (Or maybe we will think of ourselves for just ONE little bag to share on the way home in the car.)</p>
<p>Or, in our family we do online wish lists, so sometimes I can choose something from there. Just as I try desperately to find a love/heart tie-in for a Valentine&#8217;s Day gift, I scan his list for a tool/dad/beer tie-in for a Father&#8217;s Day gift.</p>
<p>Or sometimes I find that what I want from Paul on Mother&#8217;s Day is (1) getting to sleep in, even a little bit, (2) having some time in the house by myself, even a short time, (3) having someone else do a chore or two that would usually be mine, and (4) various other small considerate things. So I try to keep those sorts of things in mind on Father&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>I suggest we pool ALL our ideas here and now, and next year I will write a lovely and thoughtful post in time for us to USE them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite gift ideas for a new baby is a stack of board books I liked reading to my own kids: it&#8217;s a sentimental gift but also a practical one. I was looking at candidates for that very sort of gift, and I kept running into&#8230;<em>unusual</em> board books. Many of them seemed like they&#8217;d make great amusing gift ideas for the right recipients&#8212;but I&#8217;d need to go see them in a book store so I could make sure they were as good as their covers.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1932416455/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/babydrink-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2173" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1932416455/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Baby Mix Me a Drink</a> (photo from Amazon.com). I hadn&#8217;t realized until I went in search of a photo/link that the author Lisa Brown is married to Lemony Snicket. We bought a couple of these books a few years ago so I SHOULD know what I think of them, but all I remember is that we thought the titles and the whole concept were funnier than the actual books, but that the actual books were also funny and appealing. They make nice shower gifts, or a book to mix in with some that are more for the baby.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594745196/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/startrek-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2174" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594745196/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Star Trek Book of Opposites</a> (photo from Amazon.com). This seems like it would be a good Father&#8217;s Day gift for a new dad. (Or of course for a mother who&#8217;s a Star Trek fan, but Mother&#8217;s Day has passed.)<span id="more-2172"></span></p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805094911/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/orlakiely-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2175" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805094911/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Orla Kiely Colors</a> (photo from Amazon.com). (There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/080509492X/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Orla Kiely Numbers</a>, so those two books together might make a nice gift set.) This is one that might be a genuinely good board book in addition to something that would please the parent. I wish there were some reviews of it, or a &#8220;look inside this book&#8221; feature.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1423624742/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/janeeyre-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2176" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1423624742/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Jane Eyre</a> (photo from Amazon.com). This one has the &#8220;look inside&#8221; feature, so I can see it&#8217;s a counting book (&#8221;One governess,&#8221; &#8220;Three candles&#8221; with a quote from the book about letting candles burn at night). Kids wouldn&#8217;t get the book references, but I&#8217;d think parents would enjoy them. There are a others in this series, and more being released soon&#8212;wouldn&#8217;t that be a fun set for an English teacher, or for someone who loves classic books? It seems like it would also be neat to give the board book version and the regular version as a set to the family, like &#8220;for now&#8221; and &#8220;for later.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1582461589/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/urbanbabies-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2178" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1582461589/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Urban Babies Wear Black</a> (photo from Amazon.com). This one also has the &#8220;look inside&#8221; feature, so I see that urban babies wear black, do yoga, and visit galleries. There are many baby varieties to choose from, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1582462534/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Eco Babies</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1582462542/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Foodie Babies</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1582461724/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Country Babies</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1582462917/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Rocker Babies</a>.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1607300443/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/barackobama-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2177" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1607300443/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Barack Obama 101</a> (photo from Amazon.com). I would love if there was a whole series of these, one for each president: they&#8217;d make a fun keepsake. I would like to have one for each child, about the president who was in office when they were born&#8212;and one for myself, with the president who was in office the year I was born!</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979621380/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/sanfran-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2179" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979621380/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">123 San Francisco</a> (photo from Amazon.com). I wish this series did not refer to itself as &#8220;cool&#8221; counting books. It seems like the first rule of being cool is not labeling oneself as cool. I still like them, though: I like the illustrations, and I wish they had them for even more cities/states.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend Heather is moving across the entire country with children aged almost-3 and almost-5. If I were her I would say that as &#8220;ages 2 and 4,&#8221; to maximize the Pity Factor.</p>
<p>She is looking for ideas to keep the children entertained on the trip. If your first suggestion is &#8220;OMG don&#8217;t do it at all! Fly instead!! With the children in animal crates!!&#8221; you can save your breath because I already tried it. They will be in the car at least six days, and that is final.</p>
<p>I suggest we see if we can make this easier for her in any way. Donations of prescription medications would be excellent too, but I was thinking more along the lines of travel tips and toy ideas.</p>
<p>My tip, based on taking two much-shorter trips (1.5-days in the car each trip) with a 2-year-old and a newborn, is to plan to stop at places that have a play area or a grassy run-around area, and include in estimated trip time the amount of time it would take for the kids to run/play/climb for 15 minutes or so at each stop. Plus assume triple the number of stops needed with adults. This makes the entire trip take much, much longer.</p>
<p>My second tip is to save some stuff aside and not bring out everything on the first day of travel, or else the children will play frantically with all the toys on the first day and be bored for the rest of the trip. (This is a pointless tip, because if it were me, I&#8217;d be desperate enough on the first day to bring out anything, ANYTHING I had.)</p>
<p>Now for things to buy:</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000UJLGE/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/bluesclues-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2156" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Fresh TV/movies.</strong> Heather tells me that they already have a DVD player for the car, so I suggest buying several new DVDs. &#8230;This doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s brilliant enough to suggest, but that didn&#8217;t stop me from suggesting the kids could run around at rest stops. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000UJLGE/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Blue&#8217;s Clues</a> (photo from Amazon.com) is one of the ones I got for the just-turned-2-year-old on my own trip, so it may be too young for the 2- and 4-year-olds&#8212;but anything, ANYTHING they would like that wouldn&#8217;t be intolerable for the adults.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003AJ9LZS/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/aquadoodle-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2159" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. Water-drawing thingie.</strong> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YIX2H4/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">H-2 Whoa</a> is the one we had. It&#8217;s two-sided, so by the time you finish drawing on the second side, the first side is mostly dry and ready to use again. But if I were buying now, I&#8217;d buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003AJ9LZS/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">travel-sized Aqua Doodle</a> (photo from Amazon.com). (In fact, I DID buy it, and we still keep it in our car. I like it less because it has pre-printed rainbows/grass on it, which can kind of ruin an outer space drawing. But it IS more sensibly compact.) <span id="more-2155"></span></p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006HB9G6/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/findit-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2158" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Findy thing.</strong> We have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006HB9G6/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Find It</a> (photo from Amazon.com) and it&#8217;s one of the few toys we still own because it still gets played with. There&#8217;s also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0021WOGZA/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">pillow-type version</a> by Iplay. Crafty people could find instructions online for sewing one themselves, or making one out of a soda bottle.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0761137734/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/brainquest1-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2160" /></a><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/076113770X/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/brainquest2-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2161" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4. Brain Quest cards.</strong> I like these flashcard/activity sets because they&#8217;re all in linked bundles so the cards don&#8217;t get scattered everywhere, and because I&#8217;ve found that I can do them with a child for a surprisingly long time without wanting to leap from a moving car. Here are links to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0761137734/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">age 2-3 set</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0761166637/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">age 3-4 set</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/076113770X/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">age 4-5 set</a>.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004YV1W/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/notebooks-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2162" /></a><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049UV2LS/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/coloredpencils-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2171" /></a></p>
<p><strong>5. Coloring stuff.</strong> (Photos from Amazon.com.) There are a lot of travel-coloring options. Some are the Color Wonder type, which work great but have so few pieces of super-expensive paper. Some are dry-erase with bad reviews. My own favorite is a notebook or sketchpad: the pieces stay together, and they&#8217;re cheap, and they can be a novelty to a child accustomed to loose sheets of paper. Colored pencils are least likely to end up all over clothing or melted into the upholstery, but they&#8217;ll need sharpening so remember to bring a sharpener. I&#8217;ve given the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049UV2LS/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Melissa and Doug triangular ones</a> as gifts (with coloring/activity books) because they look so cool, but I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re any better than a set of Crayola.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002M2N9KW/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/phineasferb-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2163" /></a></p>
<p><strong>6. CDs.</strong> Choose wrong (i.e. an album you end up hating but the children end up wanting on endless repeat) and you will want to remove your own ears. But choose right (i.e., an album you don&#8217;t mind and the children like) and you will buy yourself, if not peace, at least a CHANGE in the KIND of noise. We bought this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002M2N9KW/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Phineas and Ferb album</a> (photo from Amazon.com) last summer, and it mostly kept the children from bickering when we spent an hour in the car each day driving to and from one child&#8217;s summer day camp.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00015KVB2/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/beachball-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2164" /></a></p>
<p><strong>7. Active stuff for the hotel.</strong> There isn&#8217;t a ton of space for running around in a hotel room, but it&#8217;s more space than in the car. I brought an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00015KVB2/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">inflatable beach ball</a> (photo from Amazon.com) for the hotel: nice and small when deflated, and can be kicked or thrown into the side of your face while you&#8217;re trying to lie down for just a minute after a long day in the car.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DKJGAO/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/waterwow-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2165" /></a></p>
<p><strong>8. WaterWow.</strong> WaterWow is a reusable paint-with-water: the picture colors itself in as you &#8220;paint&#8221; it with plain water, and then when it dries it&#8217;s uncolored again. I&#8217;m linking to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DKJGAO/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Thomas the Tank Engine WaterWow</a> (photo from Amazon.com) because I know Heather&#8217;s son loves Thomas, but I&#8217;d look for it in the store: on Amazon, that one is nearly twice the price of some of the others, and then shipping on top of THAT. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DKJGAY/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Hero Squad one</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DKJGB8/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">princess one</a> are less expensive and have free shipping.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00134TC10/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/leapster-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2166" /></a></p>
<p><strong>9. Hand-held gaming thing.</strong> Heather has a kid iPad with games, and that may be enough (though she anticipates arguments about whose turn it is to use it). I very reluctantly recommend a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00134TC10/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Leapster</a>, too (photo from Amazon.com). Setting that gol-danged thing up made me cry and want to break things (starting with the Leapster itself, and ending with whichever employees at Leapfrog designed and tested the set-up procedure), but ONCE THAT WAS DONE it has become a great toy and the kids use it a lot. And since the toy is a little older, a lot of the games are really cheap now: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001W2WLZM/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Up</a> for $7, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001W2WM06/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Ni Hao Kai-Lan</a> for $6.50, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MMVKT6/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Ratatouille</a> for $8.75, and so on. (Some others are nice and low but have shipping charges&#8212;but if you found several from the same seller and could combine shipping, it would still be a good deal.)</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z0VVEK/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/dogguitar-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2167" /></a></p>
<p><strong>10. Pretty much any electronic toy they don&#8217;t already have and aren&#8217;t too old for.</strong> There&#8217;s usually a whole aisle at the store of toy laptops and electronic instruments and story-telling stuffed animals and learn-to-write pads and so forth, and I would just LOAD UP. (Also load up on replacement batteries.) Henry has played with this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z0VVEK/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">dog guitar</a> (photo from Amazon.com) in the shopping cart more times than I would have suspected possible, and I can report that it is (1) kind of annoying but (2) not as annoying as when he&#8217;s NOT playing with it.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1580626416/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/everythingtravel-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2168" /></a><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671317741/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/toddlersbusybook-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2169" /></a><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0917120116/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/06/milesofsmiles-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2170" /></a></p>
<p><strong>11. Book of travel game ideas.</strong>. I think I&#8217;d look first at the library: it&#8217;s hard to tell which of the &#8220;car games&#8221; search results are good. If the library didn&#8217;t have any to read-before-buying, I&#8217;d read the reviews of each book to see which sounded like the best fit. It looks like the main trouble is that a lot of the ideas/games are for older kids. You might have better luck looking at books that aren&#8217;t specifically meant for car travel, but just have a lot of ideas for entertaining toddlers/preschoolers. (All three linked photos from Amazon.com. I think I&#8217;d need to tear the cover off that last one because it is giving me a little bit of a headache just looking at it. Let me guess: it contains instructions for singing &#8220;99 Bottles of MILK on the Wall!&#8221;)</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>Okay, I think that is all my ideas. All I can do now is send wave after wave of panicky empathy in Heather&#8217;s direction&#8212;and also send her all of you, to give her more tips and ideas. (SIX DAYS in the car. SIX.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were recently invited to a birthday party for a 2-year-old, and you know what I don&#8217;t remember? What 2-year-olds like. It&#8217;s funny how that was only three years ago and yet I had to go back into my journals to find out even what KIND of toy the kids were playing with at that age.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P13NNA/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/percussion-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2145" /></a></p>
<p>One idea we considered was musical instruments. Several of our kids were invited, so it seemed like a good way to bring a gift from each child: maybe one could bring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P13NNA/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">this cool percussion toy</a> (photo from Amazon.com), and one could bring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PMH82G/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">bendy bells</a>, and one could bring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XDSWRC/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">a harmonica</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002G92WK4/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">a kazoo</a>.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005BW71/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/gardentools-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2146" /></a></p>
<p>Or maybe one kid could bring an instrument and one could bring a set of helping/digging <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005BW71/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">garden tools</a> (photo from Amazon.com).<span id="more-2144"></span></p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003AH6NII/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/mdbeachset-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2147" /></a></p>
<p>I like the look of this Melissa and Doug <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003AH6NII/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">beach set</a> (photo from Amazon.com), and it&#8217;s particularly perfect for a late-spring or early-summer birthday.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004813L0S/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/bathcolor-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2148" /></a></p>
<p>I remember looking for fun tub stuff for this age. Some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004813L0S/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">bath tablets to change the water color</a> (photo from Amazon.com) seem like fun. Maybe these from one kid, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I7ZHO4/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">water flutes</a> from another.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00134V4L6/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/fridgetoy-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2149" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00134V4L6/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">LeapFrog fridge toy</a> (photo from Amazon.com) is more expensive, but my kids had it and liked it. It sings a little success song whenever you put in the front and back halves of a vehicle&#8212;and if you do a mismatch, it sings a silly song. I liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000096QNK/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Fridge Phonics</a> even better, and so did two of my kids, but the vehicle one was more universally enjoyed.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006IRTU0/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/geometricstacker-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2151" /></a></p>
<p>I think this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006IRTU0/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">geometric stacker</a> (photo from Amazon.com) is so pretty on the shelf, and has a nice long play time of baby to preschooler. It would make a good baby gift, too.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YIX2H4/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/waterwriter-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2152" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YIX2H4/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">A water-drawing board</a> (photo from Amazon.com) was one of our most successful toys overall. I bought one when Edward was 2 years old and we had a long car trip ahead of us, and it was great for that and great afterward too. It&#8217;s surprisingly expensive (this one would be a gift from all three kids), but I have it in my &#8220;worth it&#8221; category.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0052XY81W/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/dwellpuzzle-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2153" /></a></p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0052XY81W/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Dwell Studio puzzle</a> (photo from Amazon.com) is the kind of gift I&#8217;d give with the additional happiness of knowing it was likely to be very pleasing to the parent as well. Hip cool cute Dwell Studio animals!</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00146G706/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/beardressing-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2154" /></a></p>
<p>I love dress-up puzzles. They&#8217;re one of the few toys I will play with when a child is not even around. The Melissa and Doug <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00146G706/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">bear family</a> is a fun one to start with, and one of the few that isn&#8217;t girls-and-dresses.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I wrote about <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/2012/05/16/gift-ideas-for-a-5-year-old-pirate-edition-with-bonus-walrus/">the pirate-related ideas I was considering for Henry&#8217;s birthday</a>. This week: knights.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I03H5M/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/swordshield-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2139" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I03H5M/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Schylling Sword and Shield Set</a> (photo from Amazon.com). Henry picked this out. Does he care that he already has a couple of sword and shield sets? No. Does he care that he can&#8217;t choose the image on the shield among four possibilities? No. Does he care that the next item on his list ALSO includes a sword and shield? No. he says raptly, &#8220;Oooo, I don&#8217;t have a WOODEN one yet!!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GI0TLQ/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/blackknight-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2140" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GI0TLQ/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Small World Toys Black Knight Set</a> (photo from Amazon.com). Henry wants this more than anything else on his list. At my mom&#8217;s house he plays with a castle and knight set, and his favorite guy is one he calls Shadow&#8212;a black-armored knight. This costume would let him play Being Shadow.<span id="more-2138"></span></p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036QM45E/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-22-at-100729-am.png" alt="" width="121" height="139" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2141" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036QM45E/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Crocodile Creek Backpack in Jouster</a> (photo from Amazon.com). This photo is so darned wee, I&#8217;m thinking of uploading a customer image for Amazon to use instead. But that sounds like it would require effort. We bought this backpack for Henry for Christmas, and he loves it. It&#8217;s nice quality, and I love the way it looks. There&#8217;s a matching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036EI2IY/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">water bottle</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036QI8UE/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">lunch box</a> that I may get him later if he&#8217;s still interested in knights.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026N8A5Q/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/mdknightcostume-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2142" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026N8A5Q/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Melissa and Doug Knight Costume</a> (photo from Amazon.com) a couple of times, and look! I&#8217;m about to do it again! It&#8217;s just so great. Henry has had his for a year now, I think. I&#8217;m going to try to talk him into one of the other Melissa and Doug costumes as a Halloween costume this year, so that he can wear it trick-or-treating AND have a new play costume.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GUU22U/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/knightpuzzle-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2143" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GUU22U/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Papo 36-piece knight puzzle</a> (photo from Amazon.com). We bought this for Henry for Christmas. My main complaint is that the box doesn&#8217;t match the puzzle. (That wasn&#8217;t a surprise: there&#8217;s a picture of the puzzle on the listing. But it bothers me.) But it&#8217;s a good puzzle, and fun to do.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am getting ready for Henry&#8217;s 5th birthday. I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m feeling morose about it per se, but I keep thinking of a science fiction short story I read a long time ago where male children were taken away on their 5th birthdays and educated all in one single day by a brain implant sort of system, so that they returned at the end of that day fully adult, not needing their mothers, and chatting with their fathers about office stuff. No moroseness, though.</p>
<p>This year Henry claims to be done with dinosaurs. He likes knights, and he likes pirates.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00705Z9LI/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/walrus-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2130" /></a></p>
<p>And he likes walruses. This is not something I would have guessed about him. But a couple of months ago I was at Hallmark buying postcards to support my Postcrossing.org <strike>addiction</strike> <strike>obsession</strike> <strike>issue</strike> hobby, and I walked down the clearance aisle, and I ended up with an impulse-buy walrus: a little beanie-baby-sized guy. I&#8217;d planned to put him in with a care package, but the minute I showed the walrus to Henry, Henry was squeezing it and cuddling it and wrapping it in a blankie and pretending to give it a bottle. So for his birthday, I got him a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00705Z9LI/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Cuddlekin Walrus</a> (photo from Amazon.com). Cuddlekin is probably my top favorite stuffed animal line: they are not kidding one bit about the cuddliness. If the walrus not a hit with Henry, I&#8217;ll snuggle it myself.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ARW60U/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/piratechest-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2131" /></a></p>
<p>My parents bought Henry the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ARW60U/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Melissa and Doug Pirate Chest</a> (photo from Amazon.com), with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013OWG9A/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">extra coins</a>. (My mom checked with me first, because she knows and I know that those coins are going to end up in every single corner and under every single piece of furniture in the house. I don&#8217;t mind. Treasure hunt! And it&#8217;s not as if all of those locations aren&#8217;t currently occupied by playing cards, paper clips, toys from gumball machines, toothpicks, checkers, rubber balls that got away, etc.)<span id="more-2129"></span></p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026NDRRM/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/piratecostume-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2132" /></a></p>
<p>The pirate chest is going to be especially awesome with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026NDRRM/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">pirate costume</a> they got him last Christmas. Do you have one of the Melissa and Doug costumes yet? They are SO GREAT. They&#8217;re like the kind of costumes a school classroom might have, if it was kind of an expensive school. They&#8217;re comfortable, they&#8217;re way better quality than I&#8217;d expected, and I just love them so so much. (My only complaint: the velcro closures stick LIKE CRAZY to the fabric, so the fabric around the closures gradually gets pretty fuzzed up. But that&#8217;s not a part you SEE.) I was nervous about sizes, but reading the reviews helped (lots of people said how old their kids were, and many commented on fit); Henry is a mid-to-large 4-almost-5-year-old and the fit is very good on him with room to grow still. (We have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026N8A5Q/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">the knight costume</a> as well, which I&#8217;ll be talking about again next week when I do the &#8220;knight edition&#8221; of this post.)</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JVMG4I/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/pirateaccessories-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2133" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m debating this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JVMG4I/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">pirate accessories set</a> (photo from Amazon.com). On one hand, it looks like it pretty much duplicates everything he already has between the pirate chest and the pirate costume. On the other hand, he FLIPPED OUT when he saw it, and it DOES have a hook hand and a telescope and an earring. I think I&#8217;m likely to get it for him.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0486465675/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/piratetattoos-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2134" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0486465675/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Pirate tattoos</a> (photo from Amazon.com). I hate these. I hate skulls, and I hate the way skulls are all over boy clothes and even on girl clothes. Blick. But Henry LOVES them. There was another book of pirate tattoos but they were OF PIRATES&#8212;and I don&#8217;t think a pirate would have a tattoo of a pirate. I think a pirate would have tattoos of skulls and roses and daggers and so forth. These would also make good pirate party favors, since they&#8217;re 4-for-3: $1.50 each, but $4.50 for four.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001TJ4LWY/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/piratestamps-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2135" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001TJ4LWY/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Pirate stamps</a> (photo from Amazon.com). I should mention that Henry says he does NOT want these. But _I_ want them. I think they look like a lot of fun, and I think Henry might very well like them if they were sitting right in front of him. Note that many reviewers were surprised by the size of the stamps: each stamp is a little over an inch by a little over 3/4ths of an inch. It comes with a black stamp pad; I would probably get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007P9554/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">washable rainbow stamp pad</a> to go with it.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BR9DPK/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/piratetoob-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2136" /></a></p>
<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BR9DPK/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">&#8220;toob&#8221; (they come in a plastic tube) of little pirates</a> to decorate his cake. This worked so well last year with knights: I washed the knights and let them dry; then I made a cake in a 9&#215;13 pan and just arranged the knights on it like they were fighting. Then, after the party, the (rinsed-off) knights became another of his birthday presents. So, same thing this year, but with pirates.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.etsy.com/listing/83666264/superstar-5th-birthday-aqua-blue-kids?ga_search_query=5&#38;ga_search_type=user_shop_ttt_id_5208483'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/fiveshirt-220x183.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="183" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2137" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m also considering this <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/83666264/superstar-5th-birthday-aqua-blue-kids?ga_search_query=5&amp;ga_search_type=user_shop_ttt_id_5208483">5 shirt</a>, but I consider such things every year and yet always end up overwhelmed at the total price. If he was keener on it, though, I&#8217;d get it: birthday presents are the perfect time to justify a higher-priced item, since it&#8217;s not really &#8220;shirt&#8221; but rather &#8220;shirt + Essence of Birthday Gift.&#8221; A plain blue $6 shirt is not interchangeable.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Mother&#8217;s Day this year, Paul is taking all five kids out of the house for most of the day. I&#8217;m&#8230;not sure I can find a single thing to complain about there. I plan to buy a box of chocolates and/or a pint of ice cream ahead of time, and spend the day reading and/or watching TV. Then I&#8217;ll go to Wendy&#8217;s for lunch. Maybe bring the food home with me, just so I can eat the fries with the maximum awareness of not sharing them with anyone.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are not expecting such a nice Mother&#8217;s Day yourself? My boss is looking out for you: she&#8217;s giving away a $25 Amazon.com gift card to one commenter on this post. You don&#8217;t have to comment anything in particular, though of course we all enjoy reading stories of past outrages and disappointments! They don&#8217;t even have to be your OWN stories, if a friend of yours had a particularly good-story one. Come on, spill it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, many of us have a little shopping to do for our own mothers.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671527932/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/lightyears-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2124" /></a></p>
<p>My own mother greatly enjoyed The Cazalet Chronicles, a series of four books by Elizabeth Jane Howard. (Photo from Amazon.com.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671527932/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">The Light Years</a> (careful: there are a bunch of other books with the same name) is first, followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671527940/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Marking Time</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671527967/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Confusion</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671534297/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Casting Off</a>. The first thing you&#8217;ll likely notice is that some of the books are unusually EXPENSIVE for paperbacks. Well, perhaps it wouldn&#8217;t be wise to buy all four right of the bat anyway, until you know if your mom likes them. Get just the first one and see. Or maybe the first TWO, since the second one is the cheapest of all four.<span id="more-2121"></span></p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002XVS6A/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/cazalets-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2122" /></a></p>
<p>Or if your mother would rather watch it on TV, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002XVS6A/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">a DVD box set</a> (photo from Amazon.com) of the first part of the book series. My mom liked that too, although she said she was glad she&#8217;d read the books first. (She also liked Downton Abbey&#8212;for comparison to your mother&#8217;s tastes.)</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/downtonabbey-219x219.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="219" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2123" /></a></p>
<p>Speaking of Downton Abbey (photo from Amazon.com), I&#8217;m having a little trouble figuring this out but apparently PBS broadcast a cut version of the show? So if your mom loved the show, a nice treat might be to get the uncut UK version on DVD so she can see the whole thing: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">series one</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005Q1W10A/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">series two</a> (look in &#8220;More Buying Choices&#8221; over to the right: the one that pops up is over $50, but there&#8217;s another set for $20). But I&#8217;m a little confused because the series 1 box says PBS on it? But also says &#8220;Original UK Edition&#8221;? So I am a little fretful. Well, it would be nice to have even the PBS/cut versions on DVD!</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GW873G/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/screen-shot-2012-05-07-at-104209-am-219x220.png" alt="" width="219" height="220" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2125" /></a></p>
<p>Continuing with the theme of &#8220;Things Swistle&#8217;s Mom Likes,&#8221; my mom has and likes this little one-cup brewer (photo from Amazon.com). It takes Senseo pods, and it&#8217;s a good way to try out the K-Cup/Tassimo concept in a smaller, less expensive way: the machine is $20 instead of over $100, and my grocery store has 16-/18-packs of the Senseo pods for $4.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003F24D1M/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20'><img src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/milkandcookies/files/2012/05/creusetmug-220x215.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="147" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2126" /></a></p>
<p>And/or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003F24D1M/ref=nosim/?tag=88K18-20">Le Creuset mug</a> (photo from Amazon.com) in Cherry. My mom&#8217;s favorite color is red, but for myself I like the Caribbean (turquoise), the Dijon (yellow), or the Flame (orange).</p>

<p>My sister-in-law got me AND my mother hooked on <a href="http://www.drinkchoffy.com/ivory-coast-choffy-12oz/">Choffy</a>&#8212;it&#8217;s like coffee, but made with cacao beans instead of coffee beans. It&#8217;s too late to order for this year&#8212;well, or maybe you could print out a little picture of it (perhaps one in better focus than the one I used here) (which is from DrinkChoffy.com, I should have mentioned), and say it&#8217;s coming soon!</p>

<p>One of my favorite Etsy artists is Kristiana Parn. This sweet <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/87434788/baby-otter-mounted-print">otter print</a> (photo from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/krisblues">her Etsy shop</a>) would be great for a new mother (or for a new father, if you want to get a head start on Father&#8217;s Day).</p>
