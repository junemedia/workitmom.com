			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems like every woman who has ever been pregnant can recall a handful of crazy dreams about all things impending motherhood. They&#8217;ve dreamt about giving birth to toddler-sized babies who come out fully dressed and speaking in sentences, they&#8217;ve dreamt about nursing kittens, they&#8217;ve dreamt about giving birth while co-piloting in a twin-engine plane with Hugh Jackman. (Okay, I made that last one up, but it&#8217;s probably happened to someone.) I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve had some crazy pregnancy dreams along the way, but I can&#8217;t remember anything specific. What <em>have</em> I been dreaming about, though? Work. Yay.<span id="more-270"></span></p>
<p>I finished up my final official work project on Tuesday, and Tuesday night, I had not one but two dreams about disaster befalling my company&#8211;the most devastating being that the entire building (which was my office but <em>not </em>my office in the way that this always happens in dreams) was burned to the ground in some sort of unfortunate accident involving highly combustible tomato plants. (I know, right?) I remember seeing the building a shell of brick and cinders and thinking, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing I can do about that. Might as well just go home.&#8221; Hmm, symbolic much?</p>
<p>It could be the dream was simply a result of general anxiety mashing around in my brain and attaching itself to whatever else is floating around in there&#8211;the tomato plants growing in my backyard garden, the fires raging out of control in several states&#8211;but it could also be as obvious as my feeling a little bit &#8220;homeless&#8221; now that I&#8217;m on leave from work until mid-October. Or even that somewhere deep in my little control-freak heart, I think the whole company&#8217;s going to collapse without me around. (I don&#8217;t actually believe this. At least I don&#8217;t <em>think </em>I actually believe this.)</p>
<p>The good news is that it doesn&#8217;t really matter. Whatever happens there in my absence not my problem to deal with, and wow, what a liberating yet completely foreign feeling to be just&#8230;done (albeit temporarily) with something that has for so long been such a big part of my life. I&#8217;ve done this before and have no doubt I&#8217;ll get used to it real quick-like. Here&#8217;s hoping my subconscious can also let it go so I can enjoy these last few baby-free nights <em>sleeping </em>instead of waking up in a cold sweat.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">I go on maternity leave next Monday, and although I can’t help thinking of it as a (glorious, hard-earned, much deserved) break, I know, intellectually, that I’ll have plenty to do while I’m not working. More than plenty, in fact, and none of it involves afternoons spent sipping lemonade or getting a foot massage or lovingly monogramming a stack of burp cloths as high as the moon. Nope, for however long I have off before the baby comes, all of that &#8220;extra&#8221; (HA) time will be spent preparing for the baby by finally taking care of things I feel like I should have dealt with <em>months </em>ago. Something tells me this isn&#8217;t unusual for working women who already have at least one child at home, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not still frustrated with myself.<span id="more-269"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Last week we finally bought a box of teeny diapers, set up the crib, and washed and folded the newborn laundry. What more do we need, right? We’re lo-fi and adaptable! Bygone generations all parented children with less! It’s all going to be fine in the end! And yet…I need to pack a hospital bag (and a bag for my preschooler in case he needs to spend a few nights with a sitter), I need to find the breast pump and all its parts, I need to register the baby with a pediatrician, and I need to actually acquire, fill out, and file the paperwork that will make this much anticipated maternity leave an official, government-sanctioned reality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So although my work load is getting lighter, my to-do list is getting longer and longer and longer. As soon as I mentally clock out of my job this Friday at 5 p.m., I’ll heave a huge sigh of relief, close my eyes, and listen to the silence for approximately three seconds, and then it’ll be time to take a giant breath in and get serious about work again: the work of preparing for baby’s arrival.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Part of me has toyed with the idea of continuing at my day job right up until my due date, but the sane part of me is SO GLAD to have planned some time off beforehand (pending the baby doesn’t decide to bust out in the next few days, that is). <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingonmotherhood/2012/06/13/freelancer-maternity-leave-can-it-be-done/">I&#8217;ll still be doing some freelance work</a> during maternity leave (LIKE A CRAZY PERSON), of course, but I hope I can convince myself to use the hours I&#8217;m NOT working to actually get my house/life/self in order (before a newborn comes in like a tornado and whips it all to pieces again).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;m not a natural multitasker, so it&#8217;s been really hard to do Baby Stuff when I&#8217;ve been consumed with Life Stuff. Here&#8217;s hoping that doesn&#8217;t end up biting me in the butt. And here&#8217;s hoping the little dude stays inside for juuuuuuust a bit longer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;  Normal 0   false false false        MicrosoftInternetExplorer4  &lt;![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;   &lt;![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]&gt;-->My jobs are all deadline dependent. If I miss deadlines, I miss production windows, I mess up someone else’s schedule down the line, and I disappoint clients who then might not hire me for future jobs. I’m lucky I don’t have any bosses breathing down my neck on a daily basis, but those deadlines, man…they’re not joking around. <span id="more-268"></span><span> </span></p>
<p>With non-work stuff, though? <em>Everything </em>slips. I&#8217;m the one sending party invitations the week of the party, mailing thank you cards MONTHS late, not calling people back, forgetting the daycare check AGAIN, and generally letting things slide and/or just plain forgetting about them until someone sends me a kind email along the lines of “Hey, remember that thing you said you’d do for me a year ago?&#8221; Ugh.</p>
<p>I was always super organized at school too—work complete and turned in on time, desk/locker/backpack organized within an inch of its life—but at home my room was a perpetual tornado of clothes and books and notes from friends folded in the popular note-folding style of the week. Minus the notes, that’s pretty much what my house looks like now. Laundry to the left of me, dishes to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with only myself to blame.</p>
<p>Do I slack at home because that’s where I feel I can relax without suffering any real consequences or outside criticism? Do I slack at home because I’m not being <em>paid </em>to perform there the way I am at work and was (in grades) at school? Whatever the reason, it’s annoying and I wish there were some secret trick of motivation that would make me as on-task about everything else in life as I am when it comes to work. I’ve often wondered if I just need to hire a housekeeper and/or buy some kind of fancy planner, but now I’m thinking I just need to hire a boss who will <em>tsk-tsk</em> at me in such a way that I will be desperate to impress him/her and therefore take care of things that need taking care of and ON TIME.</p>
<p>Your turn: Do you treat your non-work life as another job, one with expectations and deadlines you strive to meet, so you can be the best mom/wife/friend you can be? Or are you just naturally organized and practically perfect in every way? Or is home your place to breathe easy, even if it means you’re consistently behind on absolutely everything?</p>
<p>(You know who I wish would respect his deadline? My baby, that’s who. His due date is July 11, but knowing that he could be here anytime within the next month—maybe three weeks from now! maybe TOMORROW!—is really cramping my style.) <span> </span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just thirteen more days until I&#8217;m officially on maternity leave from what I call my &#8220;day job&#8221;&#8211;working at home part-time for the book publishing company I&#8217;ve been with for ten years. Thirteen more days until I can ignore that email account, those Dropbox notifications, the pressing pressure that I am responsible for hundreds and hundreds of pages of someone&#8217;s near-and-dear-yet-riddled-with-typos composition. Thirteen days!</p>
<p>What shall I do to celebrate? Spend mornings napping in a hammock? Indulge in a six-hour <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> marathon? Throw a handful of confetti and then collapse in a heap because I really, really, really need this break?</p>
<p>Yes, I should definitely do all of those. Definitely. Right after I finish writing those four articles and proofing those ten posts and cleaning up that eighty-page file and invoicing for those three jobs. <em>Then</em> I will relax. I mean, I&#8217;ll relax if the baby doesn&#8217;t need me for something, because chances are he&#8217;ll arrive before all my freelance deadlines do, a situation that&#8217;s&#8230;not ideal.<span id="more-267"></span></p>
<p>I picked up a ton of extra work while my husband was unemployed, and although I was doing it for the short-term money at the time, I actually scored a number of long-term contracts that I&#8217;m enjoying the heck out of and don&#8217;t want to lose. The work is different and new, the people I&#8217;m connecting with are smart and fun, and it certainly helps to have some extra income now that we&#8217;re adding an extra person to the family, and, and, and&#8230;And yet it&#8217;s probably insane to think I&#8217;ll be able to keep up the pace of 4+ hours of freelance work a day when I add a newborn to the mix, yeah? YEAH.</p>
<p>At this point, I have only vague plans to take some time off from the freelance circuit, and those vague plans include an admittedly skimpy haitus of only two weeks after the baby&#8217;s born (and no time prior to that) before jumping back into the pool. TWO WEEKS! Am I fooling myself? (I&#8217;m fooling myself.) Am I asking for trouble? (I&#8217;m asking for trouble.) Is two weeks too short? (Two weeks is WAY too short.)</p>
<p>BUT.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to lose this work because I like it so much. I don&#8217;t want to lose it because I like the way it makes my brain feel. I don&#8217;t want to lose it because I&#8217;m kind of addicted to the flurry of checks that come in the mail on days other than the 1st and 15th. I don&#8217;t want to lose it because I think freelancing will become an even bigger part of my work life once I&#8217;m the mom to two small children.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping that because I <em>want</em> this work more than I <em>need </em>it, the act of having a baby will in short order make me want it less and therefore feel better about taking time away from it. I hope this will happen. (I think it will happen.) (It needs to happen.)</p>
<p>And honestly, I worry more about my ability to do <em>quality </em>work with a newborn in the house than I do about the practical logistics  of caring for a newborn during work hours (having been through  this once before, I now know I don’t have to be in the baby&#8217;s face  “entertaining” and &#8220;enriching&#8221; him every time he opens his eyes), and on that point alone, I should make sure I give myself enough leeway that I don&#8217;t end up doing a half-assed job for clients I owe my very best work. And that&#8217;s not to mention that above all else I also owe both myself and my new son the best of what I can be as a mother.</p>
<p>So, hello, other freelancing moms out there! What did/do you do about maternity leave? Did you take time off? Did you suffer dire consequences? Did you suffer dire consequences because you <em>didn&#8217;t</em> take time off? How short is too short?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Money is always a touchy subject, but it&#8217;s even touchier when you compare apples to apples&#8211;i.e., what your peer coworkers are making&#8211;instead of the apples-to-oranges guessing you might do of the doctor/lawyer-income couple down the block.<span id="more-266"></span></p>
<p>Last week my husband found out a former (thank god) coworker was making <em>more than twice</em> what he (my husband) was earning in a similar position. Was this a juicy tidbit of insider information? Sure. Does he wish he&#8217;d never found out? Absolutely.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about what others in your position are earning, on average, throughout the country, it&#8217;s easy enough to find statistics; <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm">here&#8217;s the Bureau of Labor&#8217;s annual report</a>. What&#8217;s harder is pinning down specifics that reflect wage differences that take into account the diversity of economic regions, years of industry experience, and individual company budgets. An annual salary of $30K a year will get you more in Duluth, MN, than it will in San Francisco, for instance, and you can&#8217;t expect the same pay from a nonprofit mom-and-pop business than from a Fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>A better way to compare might be to search for local job listings on Craigslist or Monster to see what pay ranges are being offered for jobs similar to yours. Or you could just accidentally overhear a coworker talking about her earnings and try not to be too sad (or smug!) about it. Then again, maybe it&#8217;s best to just stick your fingers in your ears and sing <em>la la la</em> whenever the subject comes up.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this is the sort of thing that can drive a person crazy if there&#8217;s nothing to be done about it. No use hand-wringing over something we can&#8217;t control, right? (Not that that&#8217;s ever stopped me from doing it at least a <em>little</em>.) On the other hand, if you find out a coworker makes more than you doing a similar job, finding that out might be the perfect impetus to finally get you to ask for that well-deserved raise or promotion.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know how much your coworkers make? Are you glad you know, or would you just as soon forget it?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we were in Utah visiting my parents a few months ago, we drove by a Walmart and, apropos of nothing, my three-year-old son announced proudly, “That’s where my mom works!” I don’t know where that came from (kid hasn’t been to a Walmart in his life), and although it was probably just a random comment, it did make me wonder if he has any idea what I do all day while he&#8217;s at daycare. <span id="more-265"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;d always assumed he knew my job involved sitting at a computer and not, say, standing behind a register or stocking shelves, but when I thought about it, why <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> he think I had some sort of service job? When we go to a store or a restaurant, he always wants to point out and acknowledge the &#8220;helpers&#8221; who are scanning our merch or cooking and bringing him food. Conversely, how many times does he go into an office building and look over the shoulders of people typing memos and consulting spreadsheets and copyediting manuscripts? Pretty much never.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My job is relatively easy to explain—I wrote some words he knows on a piece of paper and included some spelling mistakes, then told him I was in charge of fixing those sorts of things—but I wonder what other people do to explain their more complicated or esoteric careers. I grew up the child of a nurse and an electrician, and from a young age I visited their workplaces and knew the gist of what they did. I imagine this is harder for parents who, say, go to an office and project manage a technical team, or perhaps work from home as a social media consultant.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do your kids know what you do for work? How do you explain your job to them? And how important is it to you that they understand?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When my son was an infant, I had a thirty-minute office commute. When he was a toddler and I switched to working from home, I still had a fifteen-minute drive to daycare. For the two months my husband was out of work (&#8221;WAS&#8221;! HE GOT A JOB LAST WEEK!), my work day would blend right into my mom day because when the boys got home I&#8217;d still be sitting at my desk trying to eke out a few more moments of daylight productivity. When my son bursts in the door (his current bit is to announce loudly, &#8220;Hey Dad, where&#8217;s that nice lady who lives here?&#8221;), I just as often greet him with a hug as I do a &#8220;Just a minute, I&#8217;m almost done, no, you can&#8217;t sit on my lap, not right now, don&#8217;t touch that, stop, just a minute, JUST A MINUTE.&#8221;<span id="more-264"></span></p>
<p>As glad as I am to have a daily commute no longer than the fifteen-step waddle from my bed to my desk (I just made the trip to test for accuracy and also so I could cross off &#8220;exercise&#8221; on my to-do list), there is something to be said for those end-of-the-work-day drives. I wouldn&#8217;t call it &#8220;free time&#8221;&#8211;and certainly not &#8220;me time&#8221;&#8211;but it <em>was</em> a period of forced do-nothingness that allowed my mind to psychologically drift away from the office just as surely as I was physically motoring down the freeway away from it. No phone, no email, no coworkers popping in about a rush job. Just me and some music and the blinking of tail lights on the road ahead.</p>
<p>As long as I continue to work from home, I think I&#8211;well, the whole family, actually&#8211;would benefit from my instituting some sort of enforced break between the end of my work day and the resumption of my primary responsibility as Mom. Mr. Rogers had it down. Change into a comfortable sweater, trade your work shoes for your play shoes, sing a little song. Maybe all I need is to turn on a song and just sit quietly with my eyes closed for five minutes to mark the separation between these two parts of the day. Heck, maybe even loading the dishwasher or sweeping the kitchen floor would do the trick just so long as it&#8217;s something away from the computer. It doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated and it doesn&#8217;t have to take long; all it has to do is prepare me to approach my son&#8217;s daily homecoming with an open mom-heart instead of a tangled work-brain.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have tips for switching out of work mode and into mom mode?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My husband had three job interviews last week, and although no official offers have been put on the table yet, let&#8217;s just pretend everyone thinks he&#8217;s as wonderful and accomplished as I do and that in the next few days he&#8217;ll have his pick of positions.</p>
<p>Aaaaahhhh. So<em> that&#8217;s</em> what it feels like to breathe again.<span id="more-263"></span></p>
<p>In fantasizing that he&#8217;ll get more than one offer, one thing we&#8217;ve been discussing is how he chooses between the job that offers more money vs. the one that offers greater personal satisfaction. When he took his previous job, he also took a massive paycut, in part because the job before that was an anomaly and in part because he&#8217;s an altruistic soul who has a really hard time turning down &#8220;good-guy work,&#8221; even if it means his salary suffers. This is what we&#8217;re (hopefully) going to face soon: does he go with a big, rich company with great pay and stellar benefits vs. somewhere that will give him fewer dollars but more warm fuzzies?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve both worked for nonprofits for many years, and although we are certainly full of humble pride to be fighting the good fights and working for do-gooder companies instead of merely rich ones, it&#8217;s safe to say that we&#8217;re at a point in our lives now when that rose-colored philosophy might have to change. Slaving away at a nonprofit for low pay and crappy benefits in exchange for no-cost feel-goods is one thing when you&#8217;re in your twenties and single. Doing the same work fifteen years later, when you have a mortgage (or two) and a kid (or two) is a different story&#8211;a story whose climactic bit of dialogue just might need to be along the lines of &#8220;Show me the money!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, as of this second there are still no job offers, and the warm fuzzies are all being self-generated by maintaining a positive homelife, despite the stress. I have to say, though, that&#8217;s just making the money look better than ever&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;Create a dedicated office space!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get dressed every day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a shower!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put on makeup!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out and talk to real adult people, even if it&#8217;s just the cashier at the Starbucks drive-thru!&#8221; (No offense to cashiers at Starbucks drive-thrus. You make the world go &#8217;round.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny that so many of these Helpful Tips are hygiene related (funny cuz it&#8217;s true) and that, together, they make us WAHMs out to be a bunch of unkempt cavewomen who, save for the civilizing grace of the revered drive-thru cashier (and her gift of caffeine), are assumed to be perpetually one eight-hour shift away from losing our ability to walk upright and speak in full sentences.<span id="more-261"></span></p>
<p>For the most part, I find this sort of advice helpful only <em>theoretically</em> (yes, I really should take a shower), but in reality living by those well-meaning tenets isn&#8217;t the most practical way for me to balance the precarious fruit hat of responsibilities I wear most days. (It&#8217;s on loan <span class="st">from Carmen Miranda because I like to look nice while I&#8217;m doing the fancy job/house/kid/spouse dance.) </span></p>
<p><span class="st">Yeah, that whole &#8220;As a mom and a career woman, I wear many hats&#8221; thing? I only wear <em>one</em> hat, but it&#8217;s piled high with heavy expectations, each one as un-comparable to the others as apples and oranges.<br />
</span></p>
<p>The one bit of work-at-home advice I&#8217;ve tried to adhere to has been the one that goes &#8220;Maintain strict office hours!&#8221; I&#8217;m not a workaholic by anyone&#8217;s definition, but I <em>do</em> always have work on my plate, and I <em>have</em> been known to send business emails while at the dinner table, so given those two factors alone, it&#8217;s good for me to remember that working and parenting at the same time is never beneficial to anyone involved.</p>
<p>But then I read this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Work fourteen hours on a Monday if you’re on a roll because Tuesday might kick your ass.&#8221;&#8211;<a href="http://pandaamber.com/">Amber Adrian</a></p></blockquote>
<p>YES. This is <em>exactly</em> what I do. When I&#8217;m on a roll, I feel compelled to keep on rolling because I just never know what&#8217;s around the bend. As both a mother and a freelancer, I know that kids get sick, rush jobs exclaim into my inbox, and some projects take twice as long as you budget them for. It seems to make sense to skip bedtime stories some nights because the work I get done then is work I won&#8217;t be missing the next time I have to take a half-day to deal with a feverish kid. It makes perfect sense but&#8230;is it wise? Is it healthy? Am I overthinking it? (Yes, for sure, on that last one.)</p>
<p>Fellow work-at-home cavewomen, what&#8217;s your strategy? Do you keep strict office hours and only work when you&#8217;re officially on the clock? Or do you work whenever and however you can, considering it time banked for later?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A basic list of responsibilities might look like this:<span id="more-259"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>make flight and hotel arrangements</li>
<li>make appointments of any (every!) kind</li>
<li>do anything involving talking on the phone, actually</li>
<li>pay bills</li>
<li>clean spam out of my inboxes</li>
<li>clean spam* out of my fridge (*forgotten leftovers)</li>
<li>go grocery shopping</li>
<li>load the dishwasher (I don’t mind unloading)</li>
<li>clean the bathroom</li>
<li>do our taxes</li>
<li>keep track of my Groupon-type purchases before they expire</li>
<li>remind me to send birthday/anniversary/thank you cards</li>
<li>cook dinner and clean up afterward</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sounds like what I need is an assistant AND a housekeeper AND an accountant AND a personal chef. And someone to rearrange my brain so I’d actually loosen my grip and <em>allow</em> these people to help me out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>What would you delegate?</strong></p>
