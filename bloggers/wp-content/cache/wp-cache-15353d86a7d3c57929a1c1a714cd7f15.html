			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="The Office(at home) by Fabio Bruna, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/_fabio/104792456/"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/38/104792456_71001aaea2_m.jpg" alt="The Office(at home)" width="240" height="180" /></a>Here in the United States, today is Independence Day. In my family, it is also my husband&#8217;s birthday. To celebrate, we packed up the kids last weekend and drove three hours to my dad&#8217;s house. (Because doesn&#8217;t everyone want to celebrate their birthday with their inlaws?) We&#8217;ve been fishing, swimming and gorging on grilled meats - and that&#8217;s before the holiday officially arrives! We&#8217;ve also been working.</p>
<p>As usual, I&#8217;ve taken my job on the road with us. Jared has recently started working from the comfort of his laptop, joining me in my &#8220;full time, all the time&#8221; lifestyle for the moment. That means we&#8217;ve had to make two mobile offices in my dad&#8217;s home this week.</p>
<p>What does that look like?<span id="more-347"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set up shop in a recliner in the corner of the living room with my coffee on an end table beside me and my iPhone tucked in between the seat cushion and arm rest. My noise-cancelling headphones dangle around my neck when they aren&#8217;t perched atop my head. Jared oscillates between the loveseat next to me and the bed in the guest room, with a laptop propped on one knee and his new iPad propped on the other.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure we don&#8217;t look terribly productive or professional, but this is far from the strangest work environment I&#8217;ve staged for myself. (That honor probably goes to the nook in the back of a research library near the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. Or maybe that Interstate rest stop.)</p>
<p>Of course, when people like me first take on the mobile lifestyle, we imagine that we&#8217;ll be working poolside or under a beach umbrella in the Caribbean. I confess that I&#8217;ve lived that fantasy once or twice, but more often than not my reality involves yoga pants and extension cords wrapped around coffee tables.</p>
<p>Still, as unglamorous as it might be, the variety of my less-than-ergonomic work stations has not ceased to amuse me. It makes me smile to think of the income I&#8217;m earning from coffee shop booths and borrowed couches. It serves as a constant reminder that life is rarely what it seems at first glance and that the cubicle is outdated.</p>
<p>It also suggests that office furniture is way overpriced.</p>
<p><strong>What does your work space look like?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Ladder to heaven? by plastAnka, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/plastanka/4567546044/"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3072/4567546044_a83a9627eb_m.jpg" alt="Ladder to heaven?" width="240" height="160" /></a>Last month, author <a href="http://vimeo.com/42372767">Neil Gaiman spoke at the graduation ceremony for the University of the Arts in Philadelphia</a>. As you might expect, his advice was geared towards people pursuing a career in the arts; a refrain of &#8220;make good art&#8221; was repeatedly met with applause. But the successful writer also offered a simple recipe for success that can be applied to any work life.<span id="more-346"></span></p>
<p>In order to get repeat business as a creator, Neil suggests you only have to do two out of three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be good at what you do.</li>
<li>Be friendly and enjoyable to work with.</li>
<li>Be on time.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter which two - you can be generally easy to work with and timely and not be the very at what you do, and you&#8217;ll still find yourself with a steady stream of work. At least, that&#8217;s what Mr. Gaiman says. My experience says he&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found this recipe works in the corporate world and in the freelance market. It applies to sales people as much as it does writers. Work-at-home dads and forty-hours-a-week moms can find success in their chosen jobs using the same guidelines.</p>
<p>Be nice. Or be talented. Or meet your deadlines. Do two out of three and you&#8217;re doing better than most and likely to be kept on/rehired/referred. That doesn&#8217;t say much about the workforce as a whole, but I think it gives us all pretty attainable standards to achieve.</p>
<p>Did you watch the video? What did you think of Neil Gaiman&#8217;s advice to young graduates?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="All the lonely people, where do they all come from? by Stephen Brace, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevon/3645097917/"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2455/3645097917_f9dd3c52ab_m.jpg" alt="All the lonely people, where do they all come from?" width="240" height="124" /></a>As a working mom, it&#8217;s important to me to make time and space in my life for quality relationships with my husband and kids. It&#8217;s also important to me to make time for friends. Unfortunately, most of my favorite women have a hard time finding time for friendship.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that the majority of my friends work <a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/fulltimeallthetime/2012/06/06/why-we-dont-have-nice-things/">&#8220;real jobs,&#8221;</a> which means they aren&#8217;t around for coffee or lunch dates during the day. It also means most of their evenings are packed with family fun, dinner, and household chores. That leaves nights after kids are in bed, which is usually spouse time, or weekends, which are often spent at kids&#8217; events or running errands that couldn&#8217;t get done during the week. The life of a working mom doesn&#8217;t have a lot of room in it for girlfriends.</p>
<p>What are a bunch of working women to do?<span id="more-345"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to make dates with my friends. This might mean grabbing a meal together or just planning an hour to chat on the phone or someone&#8217;s back porch. I&#8217;ve found that if I don&#8217;t nail down a time to get together with my busiest friends, later turns to &#8220;oh yeah, I forgot about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, the biggest obstacle for me has been learning not to take my friends&#8217; busy-ness personally. When someone says &#8220;let&#8217;s get together later&#8221; and then never calls, I remind myself that we all have a lot going on in our lives. I try to focus on quality time rather than quantity and avoid the trap of waiting for someone else to call me first (or back.) I don&#8217;t always succeed, but I try.</p>
<p>I wonder, though, if some women are just more likely to make girlfriend time a priority. Maybe I need to branch out and connect with people who have more flexible schedules, like I do, or who also need adult interaction outside of their core family unit. I&#8217;ve read about other women who plan girlfriend getaways, and there are the infamous &#8220;ladies who lunch,&#8221; so surely I&#8217;m not the only mom out there who wants to hang with the girls. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Do you hangout with your friends regularly? How do you make the time?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Modern Times? by tallkev, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tallkev/232820568/"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/92/232820568_016c61c9a4_m.jpg" alt="Modern Times?" width="240" height="157" /></a>I don&#8217;t like to spend a lot of time bemoaning choices I made in the past. It is, for the most part, a waste of mental energy - it&#8217;s not like my regret can propel me back in time so that I can do things differently. Furthermore, I believe that each day presents an opportunity to make new choices; it&#8217;s never too late to create the life you want, blah blah blah. However, as my kids get older (my oldest is going to be in junior high), I do find that there are some parenting choices I regret, choices that aren&#8217;t always easy to undo in the here and now.<span id="more-344"></span></p>
<p>If I could go back in time, there are three things I&#8217;d do differently as a parent.</p>
<h2>1. I&#8217;d look into unschooling before sending my kids off to preschool.</h2>
<p>When my kids were born, I had absolute faith in the public school system, of which both my husband and I are products. I was convinced that a child could thrive in just about any learning environment and that attentive parents could make up for any shortcomings at home. I think I was partly right.</p>
<p>My kids have no problem navigating the current landscape of public education in our country. They pass from grade to grade, make high marks, and keep their teachers happy. They are not, however, developing a love of learning. In fact, they have both come to dread the get-it-done-at-all-costs atmosphere of today&#8217;s school systems. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not sure I have what it takes to completely change their education plan at this late stage.</p>
<h2>2. I&#8217;d have paid more attention to how I spoke in front of them.</h2>
<p>I knew intellectually that my kids were always watching and listening, and I have always been pretty mindful of how I talk <em>to</em> my children. I didn&#8217;t, however, consider how my witty sarcasm would sound coming out of the mouth of a pre-teen. It&#8217;s not pretty.</p>
<p>I also hear echoes of how my husband and I used to talk to each other (before marriage counseling) in the way my kids talk to one another. It breaks my heart and fills me with guilt and regret.  I&#8217;m trying to set better examples now, but I it&#8217;s hard to unteach habits they&#8217;ve already learned.</p>
<h2>3. I wouldn&#8217;t have had cable TV.</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t hate television and have no problem letting a child be entertained by a movie. My beef is with the marketing that happens during the constant commercials on children&#8217;s cable channels. My daughter was in tears the other day because we told her she couldn&#8217;t spend $45 on a light-up pillow. &#8220;But no one wants to be afraid of the dark!&#8221; she cried, repeating words from the Dream Lites commercial that loops between her favorite Disney shows.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t blame the marketers (although I confess to wanting to strangle a few ad execs that day.) The responsibility to shield my daughter from those influences is mine, and I fell down on the job. I assumed it would be easy to just keep saying no (which we do.) I didn&#8217;t anticipate that the same tactics used to convince adults we <em>need</em> stuff to be happy would work on my children.</p>
<p><strong>What would you do differently?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Day 21 Occupy Wall Street October 6 2011 Shankbone 16 by david_shankbone, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shankbone/6219944289/"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6050/6219944289_a937854ef9_m.jpg" alt="Day 21 Occupy Wall Street October 6 2011 Shankbone 16" width="240" height="167" /></a>It&#8217;s not uncommon to blame children for a couple&#8217;s inability to have nice things. My husband and I, however, have no one but ourselves to blame.</p>
<p>A year ago, my husband and I sold just about everything we owned - including our beautiful home and my beloved shoe collection - so that we could move into an RV and travel for a year with our kids. That year of travel has come to an end and we now have room to put stuff again, but we&#8217;re not running out to replace all of our stuff. Why? Because we don&#8217;t want to go back to real jobs.</p>
<p><span id="more-343"></span></p>
<p>At first, I worried we were being immature. <em>Real grown ups have real jobs.</em></p>
<p>When my husband, Jared, quit his job so that we could travel, it was supposed to be temporary. He&#8217;d find a job when we were done traveling, even if it was in a different field (we often joked that he was going to use our time on the road to decide what he wanted to be when he grew up.) But then he got to spend all of his time with us, teaching and getting to know the kids in ways he&#8217;d never been able to before.</p>
<p>Real grown ups might have real jobs, but it sure was nice getting to spend time together.</p>
<p>I assumed traveling for a year would open up extraordinary career opportunities for me as a writer. As it turns out, spending most of my time traveling instead of marketing my business actually stunted my freelancer income (who knew!?) I was forced to <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/fulltimeallthetime/2012/05/02/is-it-time-to-quit/">re-evaluate my goals</a> and thought about applying for sales jobs in <a href="http://inpursuitofhappiness.net/blog/2012/05/11/were-moving-to/">our new city</a>. But I hate working in sales, no matter how good I am at it, and I like having the freedom to come and go as I please and spend time with my friends and family.</p>
<p>Real grown ups might have real jobs, but it sure is nice to have lunch with my husband.</p>
<p>The solution for us, at this point in our lives, is to keep our expenses low, low, low and our savings as in tact as possible. That means we aren&#8217;t buying much and we entertain ourselves with free or very cheap options. It means we&#8217;re moving into an apartment instead of a large home. It means we still only have one car and have no plans to buy another one.</p>
<p>Of course, we still have bills to pay. Kids need to eat and they outgrow clothes. We have cell phones and health insurance and like to travel. Both Jared and I do need to work, but we have a lot more freedom to do work we enjoy when we don&#8217;t need to make near as much money. I have continued to write, now with more marketing, and have picked up several new writing gigs in the last few weeks. Jared has spent the last couple of months learning about daytrading (which, yes, scares the crap out of me.)</p>
<p>Is it immature? Maybe. But as I was writing this post, my kids were playing with their cousins in the next room and I overheard this conversation:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a daddy when I grow up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you&#8217;re the dad, you have to get a job and then you miss out on childhood!&#8221;</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll hold off on getting a real, grown up job for as long as I can, even if it means I don&#8217;t have (very many) nice things.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a &#8220;real job&#8221;? Do you ever fantasize about trading it in for something that paid less but required less of your time?</strong></p>

<p>How will we keep the kids entertained while still managing to work so that we can also keep them fed?</p>
<p>Summer breaks are especially difficult, I&#8217;ve found, because I&#8217;d rather be outside playing or taking the kids to the pool than working. (You&#8217;re never too old to appreciate that sunshine is better than the glow of a computer screen.) This year, however, I&#8217;m looking forward to my kids&#8217; break from their school schedule and the added flexibility it provides our already loosey-goosey lives<span id="more-342"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my summer survival plan in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>I schedule only the things that absolutely have to be done at a set time, and everything else gets put on a to-do list.</li>
<li>At the beginning of each week, I make my daily to-do lists for the upcoming week.</li>
<li>I keep my daily lists short, allowing for the unexpected tasks that will needed to be added as I go.</li>
<li>I prioritize tasks based on importance, making it easier to postpone non-essential chores when something more important comes up.</li>
</ul>
<p>(If you&#8217;ve ever used the Franklin Covey planning method, you&#8217;ll recognize these as the tenets of his system. If you haven&#8217;t, I recommend checking it out his book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743269519/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=misbri-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0743269519">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a></em>.)</p>
<p>Now, the idea of to-do lists are nothing new, to me or anyone else. But what I&#8217;m doing differently is letting go of the notions that <strong>everything needs to be scheduled</strong> and <strong>my list needs to be completed every day. </strong>I&#8217;m working towards letting my days become a more accurate reflection of my priorities by leaving room for flexibility.</p>
<p>In the past, I&#8217;ve tried to make my schedule reflect my priorities. I&#8217;ve set aside time for things like movie nights or ice cream runs, but I could never force my loved ones to connect with me during those times - and only those times. I couldn&#8217;t avoid my daughter coming to me in the middle of the morning to tell me all about butterflies or my son deciding sometime in the afternoon to finally tell me how last night&#8217;s baseball game went. Ultimately, it&#8217;s these constant, little, and important interruptions that make parenting so rewarding - and school vacations so tricky for me - and yet they were the things I was putting off until later because I had things to do. Not necessarily more important things, but things that were not yet checked off.</p>
<p>This summer, my goal is to live by the list, the weather, and the temperament of the people who matter most to me. I&#8217;ll focus on what needs to be done, but know when I can say &#8220;sure, let&#8217;s go play, I can finish this up later.&#8221; I&#8217;ll also know when to say, &#8221; go play with your cousins, I have to finish this project this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your trick for balancing summer fun with real work?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Untitled by Dan Queiroz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nyllows/5203459330/" title="Untitled by Dan Queiroz, on Flickr"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4129/5203459330_628c0f3087_m.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="240" height="167" /> </a> I&#8217;ve been writing online since 2005. I started with an alias and did many of the reckless things that one does when they are anonymous - like talk smack about their mother. When my mother found my thinly veiled musings, I realized there was no such thing as being truly anonymous online. I decided to embrace that and threw myself out into the world with my words - warts and all.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t have warts, but I do suffer from depression. I&#8217;ve also been to marriage counseling, have a brother who has been arrested, and have had more than my fair share of struggles with self doubt. It&#8217;s easy to say that now, because I&#8217;ve already said it numerous times in black and white on my blog or one of the numerous other websites I write for.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m authentic, baby. I&#8217;m real and raw, and I have fan letters that say that is fantastic.</p>
<p>I wonder, however, if it was also very stupid, at least professionally speaking.<span id="more-341"></span></p>
<p>Maybe a prospective client doesn&#8217;t want to work with someone who once laid in bed for a week, even though I&#8217;ve never let my depression interfere with a deadline. Perhaps my constant babbling about fears overshadows the fact that I&#8217;m actually good at what I do. I imagine it&#8217;s hard to see someone&#8217;s talent when they&#8217;re publishing laundry lists of their insecurities.</p>
<p>I worry, too, because it&#8217;s not 2005 anymore; I&#8217;ve grown as a person since I started documenting my every thought online. Sometimes being online feels a bit like going back to my old hometown: I have the shadows of who I was in the past following me. I could move away from my high school, but there&#8217;s no leaving the Internet behind.</p>
<p>Yes, I wonder if I have said too much.</p>
<p>But the words have already been written and read. There&#8217;s no unringing that bell.</p>
<p>The beauty of having been overexposed for so long is that I am less at risk to find myself in a work environment that is a horrible fit for me. I might not like the idea of missing out on opportunities because I&#8217;ve been a bit liberal with my personal sharing, but those are probably opportunities better suited for someone who doesn&#8217;t think child birth is suitable dinner conversation. Having a raw version of myself indexed by Google makes it harder to interview my way into a situation I&#8217;d eventually hate. Score one for authenticity.</p>
<p>The truth is, all of us have pieces of our past floating around us.  Whether it&#8217;s old pictures we get tagged in on Facebook or the friend  requests we choose to ignore, reminders of who we once were are  everywhere. Sure, some people developed the wisdom of discretion sooner  than others, but I suspect secret pasts are no less haunting than  blogged ones. No matter how well or poorly we&#8217;ve hidden our beta versions, their remnants will always exist</p>
<p>The challenge now isn&#8217;t to convince potential clients and employers that I am capable of being professional or to make my colleagues see how much I&#8217;ve grown in the last decade. The trick, I think, is to remember that truth myself - and stop being afraid of who I was.</p>

Her personal email was admittedly still a mess. I found myself wondering not about the woman&#8217;s organizational skills, but about how many email addresses she had.<span id="more-340"></span></p>
<p>I have two. Well, I have two email addresses that I actively check. According to the settings of my Gmail account, I actually have four email addresses that funnel into my main one. I&#8217;ve also discarded a few in the last year in an effort to streamline my life.</p>
<p>I have two Facebook pages, a personal one and <a href="http://facebook.com/inpursuitofhappinessblog">one for my blog</a> . I have two active websites, including one promoting my work as a <a href="http://brittreints.com">freelance writer</a> . I have accounts on Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Foursquare.</p>
<p>I have one phone number (OK, two if you count the one from Google Voice that I never give out.)</p>
<p>I can be reached at any time, any number of ways. That sounds like a good thing, but I wonder if our plethora of communication tools is actually making it more difficult to connect with people.</p>
<p>The first thing I do when I get up is <a href="www.workitmom.com/bloggers/fulltimeallthetime/2012/03/14/update-on-operation-no-computer-in-bed/">check my email</a> . I then move on to Facebook (both pages) and Twitter, checking for any new mentions or messages. I hit refresh on my email again before popping open Instagram. After about 45 minutes, I&#8217;m now ready to actually get out of bed and say good morning to my family. I repeat this exhaustive check-in process several times a day.</p>
<p>It frightens me to think about how many hours I devote to checking for messages each week. Some days I don&#8217;t have enough time left over to actually respond, especially with lengthy emails, but I wonder if I would if I had a few less social networks on which I was afraid of ignoring people.</p>
<p>The checking in has become habitual for me, I admit. I shut off the reminders on my phone &#8212; nothing dings, shakes, or flashes when I get a new message &#8212; in a meager attempt to break my addiction. The result is just more use of the refresh button.</p>
<p>(I just checked my email on my phone again before finishing that paragraph.)</p>
<p>Checking emails, Twitter, etc. etc. etc. has become my go-to time filler. I look when I&#8217;m standing in line, going to the bathroom, or waiting for the commercials to finish. I look for new replies while I&#8217;m waiting for the tub to fill or the water on the stove to boil. Someone might be trying to reach me!</p>
<p>The thing is, I have two kids. I lament the speed at which they&#8217;re growing up and how soon they will be too far away to talk to. My oldest son is already spending more and more of his time on his own digital screen, leaving me with precious few opportunities to actually talk to him. And I&#8217;m spending them checking to see if anyone is being ignored.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid to miss out on a new message, but I know it&#8217;s causing me to miss out on the fleeting moments of real connection. I am, like most of us, entirely too easy to reach, and my attention is too hard to hold.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just not sure what to do about it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Raleigh 048 by miss-britt, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/emmandevin/5882788628/" title="Raleigh 048 by miss-britt, on Flickr"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5072/5882788628_6767ab76ea_m.jpg" alt="begin with the end in mind" width="240" height="159" /> </a> <em>Begin with the end in mind.</em></p>
<p>It means to live with intention, and to be clear on what that intention is. Successful entrepreneurs know that a clear picture of the end, the goal, is crucial. Whether opening a new store or starting out as a freelancer, a proper business plan tells where to invest your most precious resources: time and money.</p>
<p>It makes sense to begin with the end in mind, to decide where you&#8217;re going before you start.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a little trickier is taking the time to stop and seek directions when you&#8217;re already flying down the highway.</p>
<p><span id="more-339"></span></p>
<p>My friend Karen wrote recently about a <a href="http://www.chookooloonks.com/blog/random-thoughts-on-solo-brainstorming">brainstorming session she had with herself</a> . She&#8217;s a self-employed writer, speaker, and photographer and is in complete control of the direction in which her business runs. Her solo strategizing allowed her to cut ideas that weren&#8217;t working and come up with new ones, better ones. As Karen said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;sometimes &#8212; especially because I work for myself, and have no one to  answer to but me &#8212; it makes sense to take a day from my usual routine,  fly up to 30,000 feet, check out the view of what I&#8217;m doing with my life  and my work from up there, and make adjustments accordingly&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>I realized it&#8217;s been a really long time since I&#8217;ve done that professionally. I suspect most of us don&#8217;t often stop and readjust where we&#8217;re at - and more importantly, where we&#8217;re going - once we&#8217;re already in motion. How can we? There are bills to pay, deadlines to meet, and dinners to cook. Like Newton said, it&#8217;s not easy to stop a ball that&#8217;s already rolling - and most of us are rolling all the time!</p>
<p>But things change. Tiny adjustments made here and there can throw us way off track without us even noticing. We can be hurtling in the completely wrong direction or spinning in circles, but we don&#8217;t even realize it because all of our attention is dedicated to keeping moving.</p>
<p>I detest the idea of stopping. I don&#8217;t want to waste time evaluating and recalculating, and I absolutely do not want to even consider having to scrap old ideas that I&#8217;ve invested time into (even if I do find they aren&#8217;t working.) I cringe at the idea of having to backtrack, but as another smart writer pointed out once, <a href="http://writeeditrepeat.blogspot.com/2010/11/can-taking-step-backward-secure-your.html">sometimes you have to take a few steps back in order to secure the progress that&#8217;s already been made</a> .</p>
<p>Journeys are rarely comprised of a single straight line. They require turns both gentle and sharp, stops for refueling, and even the occasional backtrack. But hey, those are the makings of a great ride.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="crossroads by claire1066, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/claire1066/4313853201/"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4029/4313853201_6ea7256654_m.jpg" alt="crossroads" width="240" height="240" /></a>I&#8217;ve been working towards one significant professional goal for several months now:</p>
<p>Get published in print.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s not cool to admit out loud, but whatever.)</p>
<p>In order to research that goal, I&#8217;ve invested hours and money on research and tools. I&#8217;ve pushed through the scary first steps and I&#8217;ve &#8220;put myself out there.&#8221; A lot.</p>
<p>Thus far, all of my bylines are still digital.</p>
<p>The last few days I&#8217;ve been struggling with the decision to quit. It&#8217;s hard to work with no feedback (which is pretty typical in publishing) and I&#8217;m cognizant of all the people who want to be published writers and never are. My family is planning a move and will be setting up a new home soon, which is going to require money I&#8217;m not making from researching and pitching. I&#8217;m going to have to make some choices about the future of my career. But how?<span id="more-338"></span></p>
<p>I hate the idea of quitting. Quitting guarantees that the dream will not be realized. Quitting seems contrary to my core beliefs about optimism, faith, and perseverance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I appreciate the value in letting go. I know that letting go of the things that weigh us down frees up space in our life for things that can feed and refuel us. Letting go is rarely easy, but it&#8217;s often necessary for progress.</p>
<p>The problem is, It&#8217;s not always easy to tell the difference between quitting too soon and letting go just in time.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s no right answer here. Real life decisions are not between right and wrong. There is no door number 1 with a Hawaiian vacation and door number 2 with a box of macaroni and cheese. Behind both doors are merely different opportunities, different possibilities for how things might go. That&#8217;s part of what makes choosing so tricky. We make lists of pros and cons in the hopes of picking right, when right does not exist.</p>
<p>There is only, as my mother reminded me this week, the next best decision.</p>
<p>So how do I decide what is the best decision right now?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been swimming in fear lately. That, I know, is a horrible environment for decision making. In order to get that under control, I talked to my doctor about adjusting my anti-depressants (extreme stress is a game changer for people with depression) and I&#8217;m sitting down to look at the cold, hard facts today. That means getting an accurate picture of what my family needs from me, not just an ambiguous feeling of them needing more. I&#8217;ll be whipping out the spreadsheets, doing some math, and setting realistic deadlines.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be rereading my personal mission statement. Yes, I have one. It reminds me of my core values and was written when I was at peace, which makes it a reliable compass at times like this. While the numbers tell me where I need to go, my core values set the parameters within which I must get there.</p>
<p>Overcoming fear with knowledge and focusing on my values will, I hope, help me choose my next best step. That may mean quitting (or letting go), or it may mean me pushing on. Perhaps it will mean making adjustments. Whatever I decide, I know it won&#8217;t be right.</p>
<p>Or wrong.</p>
