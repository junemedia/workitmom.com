			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love everything in my closet; I try to make a point of not buying anything I can&#8217;t see myself still wearing in a year. Or two. Or, in some cases, 15. (I have a cashmere twinset that I bought in 1997. Still wearing it! Go me.)</p>
<p>In order to make things last, I hand wash a majority of my wardrobe &#8212; everything from pricey pieces, like my cashmere sweaters and washable silk blouses to super cheap shorts and tees. Why bother? Because no matter what the price point of my clothes, I want them to last as long as possible, with no shrinking or fading or excessive wear and tear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://workingcloset.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/photo3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3686" src="http://workingcloset.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/photo3.jpg" alt="#getdressed" width="480" height="480" /></a><br />
<em>These shorts do not do in the washing machine. Ever.</em></p>
<p>Things I make a point of hand-washing: Cashmere sweaters, bras, anything I don&#8217;t want to accidentally shrink, anything that would need to be ironed if it went in the washing machine (hand washing leaves things less wrinkled).</p>
<p>Things I do not hand wash: Running clothes, underwear, basic workhorse tees, anything belonging to my husband and children (although my husband&#8217;s fancy pants cycling kit doesn&#8217;t go in the dryer and he sends his dress shirts to the laundry because they do a better job, of course). Swimsuits &#8212; mine and theirs &#8212; go in the washing machine, in a lingerie bag, but get line dried. My jeans also go in the machine, inside out, and are hung to dry. Everyone else&#8217;s jeans? In the dryer, baby. Always.</p>
<p>(The dryer actually does the most damage to your clothes. Where do you think all that lint comes from? It&#8217;s your clothes, slowly disintegrating! Which is just sad.)</p>
<p>I typically do my hand-wash laundry once a week, often early in the morning when no one else is awake yet. It takes me maybe 40 minutes to launder everything I wear during the week. Here&#8217;s how I hand wash, in five easy steps.<br />
<span id="more-638"></span></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/engageokc/7558132330/" title="sink by Engage OKC, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7558132330_3cf86d1a94.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="sink"></a><br />
<em>What you will need: sink, detergent, towel. That&#8217;s it!</em></p>
<p><strong>Step One: Clean the sink.</strong><br />
I hand wash my clothes in the kitchen sink, because it&#8217;s big enough to easily accommodate multiple pieces at one time. And since I am totally crazy a little bit Type A   fairly neat, the sink is essentially always clean, so prepping it for a load of washing is simple; I just scrub it out with dish detergent and hot water and rinse with cool water. Ready to wash!<br />
<strong><br />
Step Two: Fill the sink with cold water and gentle detergent.</strong><br />
For everyday pieces (shorts, pants, dresses, etc) I use Woolite; for cashmere sweaters, I use Johnson&#8217;s Baby Shampoo. I pour a little detergent under the running water and let the sink fill up. While the sink is filling, I sort the laundry by color. I have a basket that lives in my closet and just holds my hand-wash pieces &#8212; that way they don&#8217;t get mixed in with the rest of the laundry by mistake.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/engageokc/7558131860/" title="shorts by Engage OKC, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7249/7558131860_34b5f060df.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="shorts"></a></p>
<p><strong>Step Three: Toss in the clothes.</strong><br />
I wash like colors together, to prevent bleeding. If anything needs to be pretreated, I take care of it before I toss it in the water. I make sure each piece is totally waterlogged by squeezing gently &#8212; no wringing, of course, because that stretches the fabric. Then I set the kitchen timer for 5 minutes and go do something else. Like browse Pinterest. For example.</p>
<p><strong>Step Four: Drain and rinse.</strong><br />
Exactly like it sounds: Drain the sink, and rinse garments until the water runs clear. Then gently squeeze out any excess water. Again, do not wring &#8212; seriously, that&#8217;s so bad for the material. Give your clothes a little love and they will love you back. Or something like that.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/engageokc/7558132904/" title="towel by Engage OKC, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7252/7558132904_3555ef210f.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="towel"></a></p>
<p><strong>Step Five: Blot excess water with a towel.</strong><br />
This is the tricky part (and it&#8217;s really pretty easy): Spread a clean, dry towel on a flat surface (I use my kitchen counter) and lay your laundry flat on top of it, one piece at a time. Roll each piece in the towel and gently squeeze the roll to absorb any extra water. DO NOT WRING. (That should be my mantra, yes?) Unroll the towel and either hang or lay flat to dry, depending on the garment. I hang dresses and heavy shirts, and lay everything else out flat.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it!</p>
<p>To make hand washing even easier, I carry a <a href="http://www.tide.com/en-US/product/tide-to-go.jspx">Tide To Go pen</a> with me at all times to deal with stains on the spot, which makes the actual washing that much easier. Those pens are the best thing to ever happen to your closet. Get three, now, and keep one with you at all times. Seriously.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you have a Do Not Wear list? Are there things that you just will not put on your body, no matter what your age or size or how cute they look on someone else? Or are you game for anything?]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday&#8217;s post on <a href="http://workingcloset.com/2012/05/30/how-old-is-too-old/">shorts after 40</a> generated some interesting discussion, about age and style and what counts as appropriate. Several of you declared ultimatums: <a href="http://www.outsidevoice.net/">Pam</a> warned against the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/workingcloset/posts/238713059570907">bandage dress</a>, for one, and someone else (sorry!) cautioned against flowered headbands. And then there&#8217;s the gray area of rompers &#8212; I say no to the romper if you&#8217;re over 10, but not everyone agrees.</p>
<p>Which brings me to a larger question: Do you have a Do Not Wear list? Are there things that you just will not put on your body, no matter what your age or size or how cute they look on someone else? Or are you game for anything?</p>
<p>Here are my Do Not Wear pieces.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/7316396150/" title="Gwyneth+Paltrow+5th+Annual+Women+Film+Pre+crL3pT4XZYQl by Working Closet, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7217/7316396150_999aaf22f4.jpg" width="306" height="500" alt="Gwyneth+Paltrow+5th+Annual+Women+Film+Pre+crL3pT4XZYQl"></a><br />
<em>Oh Gwyneth. Why???.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Jumpsuit.</strong> Yeah, that is not happening. Ever. I&#8217;m not wearing anything that requires me to undress to pee. Forget it. (See also: Romper.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Strapless.</strong> I love a summery strapless dress, but it just does not work for me. Something about the combination of my wee tiny head and my wee tiny shoulders make me look &#8230; Off. Wrong. Weird. So not the look I&#8217;m going for. Ever.<br />
<strong><br />
3. Thongs.</strong> <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingcloset/2011/09/16/the-underwear-conundrum-take-two/">We&#8217;ve discussed this before</a>. No.<br />
<strong><br />
4. Cutoffs.</strong> I love the <em>idea</em> of denim cutoffs, but I cannot make them work for me. And yet, every summer I think, &#8220;Ooh that would be cute!&#8221; And I try and it isn&#8217;t. So I&#8217;m making it a personal style rule &#8212; no cutoffs. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>5. Printed maxi dress.</strong> I see them on other girls and think, &#8220;Cuuuuute!&#8221; But I cannot pull this off, for whatever reason. Frankly, I&#8217;ve got too much else going on to spend time figuring out why, so I&#8217;m just saying a blanket <em>no</em> to printed maxis in my closet. It&#8217;s that easy.<br />
<strong><br />
Your turn! Share in the comments. Inquiring minds want to know. </strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer’s here, and that means shorts — maybe not for every day, but at some point. I’m totally in love with my shorts this year, largely because it’s been hot here since March and I figured that I might as well get excited about summer clothes, since I will apparently be wearing them until Thanksgiving. Or something like that.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/7301073914/" title="c0fae0d0a8d411e1be6a12313820455d_7 by Working Closet, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7093/7301073914_4cb317a3bf.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="c0fae0d0a8d411e1be6a12313820455d_7"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always worn long shorts &#8212; the longer the better. Not because I love long shorts &#8212; I don&#8217;t really; they&#8217;re not particularly comfortable or practical or flattering. It was mostly because I felt like short shorts were for some other woman, someone in her 20s who hadn&#8217;t had two babies and whose thighs were smaller than mine.</p>
<p>Of course, I also wore long shorts in my 20s because my legs weren&#8217;t model-thin and short shorts were for girls who were prettier than I was. Which meant that in my 40s, when I realized that my 20-year-old body was gone forever, I spent a lot of warm weather days feeling like I had really missed the boat on shorts. And of course, I thought, I&#8217;m too old for those short shorts now.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/7296730746/" title="34f7ad76a84c11e1b2fe1231380205bf_7 by Working Closet, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8009/7296730746_91b825cc44.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="34f7ad76a84c11e1b2fe1231380205bf_7"></a></p>
<p><span id="more-634"></span><br />
I hear women say all the time that they&#8217;re &#8220;too old&#8221; for certain styles &#8212; I say it myself, constantly, about all the fab blue nail polishes I see everywhere. I&#8217;ve tried them and I just can&#8217;t pull it off. I&#8217;m too old! Except that that isn&#8217;t really what I mean. The blue pedicure doesn&#8217;t work for me because it doesn&#8217;t fit my style, which is essentially conservative and classic. It has nothing to do with my actual age.</p>
<p>But then there are the rules about age and style: No shorts after 30! No bikinis after 35! No miniskirts after 40! I&#8217;m 44 and I&#8217;m breaking all of these rules (go me) because I think style rules should be about finding what fits, not about arbitrarily avoiding out because of your age. </p>
<p>(I do feel compelled to say this, however: Grown up women should not be shopping in the Junior department. Those clothes are designed for the body and the wallet of someone who is not old enough to drive. Wearing them will not make you look younger &#8212; in fact, dressing like a kid makes you look older. Trust me.)</p>
<p>Dressing your age doesn&#8217;t mean giving up entire categories of clothing; it means thinking carefully about your current shape and your current lifestyle and choosing pieces that fit both those things properly. I&#8217;ve become a big advocate of shorter shorts, even for women my age, because a mid-thigh hemline makes everyone&#8217;s legs look longer and slimmer. But opting for a shorter short &#8212; or for any shorts at all &#8212; isn&#8217;t just about finding what flatters your legs. It&#8217;s about surrendering these arbitrary ideas about what it means to be &#8220;old.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Do you worry about dressing your age &#8212; or about looking old? Or do you have some other measure of what&#8217;s appropriate for you?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring is here, which means that my Twitter feed is full of questions about alternatives to shorts. I love shorts, but as a former shorts boycotter, I understand the resistance many women have to them. The logical alternatives to shorts are skirts and capri pants &#8212; and for many moms, capri pants seem more practical and logical.</p>
<p>The danger of capri pants is that they can go from chic to frumpy so easily, and no one wants that. I&#8217;m assuming that the whole reason you&#8217;re not wanting to wear shorts is that you&#8217;re concerned about your legs, but keep in mind that the wrong capri pants can be even more unflattering than the right shorts.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a visual:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/7164946768/" title="Screen Shot 2012-05-09 at 9.40.42 AM by Susan Wagner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5323/7164946768_e88327bfc4.jpg" width="332" height="498" alt="Screen Shot 2012-05-09 at 9.40.42 AM"></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of things wrong with these pants &#8212; specifically, the length, the width, and the details. I&#8217;ll break it down for you:</p>
<p><strong>Length</strong><br />
The pants in the photo are bad because they hit the model at the widest part of her calf, which makes her legs look wider. Avoid this by choosing a cropped pant that hits just above the slimmest part of your ankle (typically an inch or two above the ankle bone). Pants that stop just above your skinny bits draw attention to those bits, while pants that stop just above the wide parts make you look wider. </p>
<p><strong>Width</strong><br />
The pants in the photo are super skinny; that, plus the awkward knee length, makes it look like the model is straining the fabric, which is not slimming. Instead, look for a capri that falls straight from the widest part of your hip. Steer clear of pants that taper at the ankle; this creates an ice cream cone shape that isn&#8217;t flattering on anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong><br />
Keep your capris sleek and minimal; too many details just add bulk and draw attention to the parts you&#8217;re trying to camouflage. Slash pockets widen your hips, while an overstated front seam cuts your leg in half. Stick with a flat-front capri with minimal detailing; avoid flap pockets and cuffs, too, as they add bulk in the wrong places. </p>
<p>So what do the right capri pants look like? Like this: </p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/7165226200/" title="Screen Shot 2012-05-09 at 10.30.16 AM by Susan Wagner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7081/7165226200_741527f024.jpg" width="349" height="498" alt="Screen Shot 2012-05-09 at 10.30.16 AM"></a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you know how to choose the right SPF sunscreen, and how to apply it correctly? It's time for a quick refresher, before the pool opens and summer starts for real.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am very, very fair skinned; I don&#8217;t really ever tan. Instead, I burn almost instantaneously, which means that I have resolved myself to a lifetime of looking like an extra from the &#8220;Twilight&#8221; saga. My goal every summer is to go to the pool as often as possible and never have tan lines. </p>
<p>With the right sunscreen, a big hat and a chair in the shade, that is totally doable, by the way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve not always been quite so sun smart; as a child, I was burned more times than I can count. In particular, I remember entire summers where my nose would burn and peel, layer after layer of skin flaking off and turning pink and flaking off. Nobody thought anything of it; that&#8217;s just what happened when you played tennis and rode your bike and swam and spent every waking minute of every day outdoors. </p>
<p>As an adult, I have become a hard-core sunscreen advocate. I&#8217;ve been wearing sunscreen daily for nearly 25 years now, winter and summer, rain or shine. And it has paid off &#8212; recently, the aesthetician who tends to my eyelashes and eyebrows asked if I&#8217;d had Botox. No, I said, and she marveled at how few wrinkles I have. </p>
<p>Sunscreen FTW!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/6962047508/" title="166aa0b68d6211e19e4a12313813ffc0_7 by Susan Wagner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7082/6962047508_8d0f576fc9.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="166aa0b68d6211e19e4a12313813ffc0_7"></a><br />
<span id="more-630"></span><br />
While I&#8217;ve dodged some of the more obvious signs of sun damage, I haven&#8217;t escaped the consequences of all those sunscreen-free years. I had a spot on my nose biopsied today, because my dermatologist (who has <em>great</em> skin, of course) is convinced that it&#8217;s basal cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s skin cancer, people.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it&#8217;s the good kind of cancer &#8212; basal cell, according to my doctor, will not kill me (phew). But it was still a little nerve wracking to hear the C word, even in it&#8217;s most innocuous form. And it reminded me that with the pool opening in a few weeks (five, precisely, if you start counting from this coming Saturday), it&#8217;s time for a quick sunscreen refresher.</p>
<p><strong>Protect your face with an SPF of at least 15.</strong> Using a foundation with SPF? That&#8217;s good, but you can do better. Foundation is designed to rest on top of your skin, which means that as your day goes on, it will slide and wear off, leaving you unprotected. For better coverage, opt for a light moisturizer with SPF; apply foundation over it. And don&#8217;t assume that if your moisturizer has an SPF of 25 and your foundation has an SPF of 15 that your total is a 40 &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t work that way. The higher number is all the protection you&#8217;re getting. I&#8217;m a big fan of Neutrogena&#8217;s sunscreens; for day, I wear <a href="http://www.neutrogena.com/product/healthy+skin+enhancer.do?sortby=ourPicks">Healthy Skin Enhancer</a>, which is a light tinted moisturizer with an SPF of 20. For more extensive sun exposure, I wear <a href="http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+sheer+dry-touch+sunblock+spf+70.do?sortby=ourPicks">Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock</a> (SPF 70), with or without makeup.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget about your body.</strong> For daily wear, opt for something like <a href="http://www.lubriderm.com/daily-moisture-with-spf-15-Lotion">Lubriderm&#8217;s Daily Moisture</a> or <a href="http://www.eucerinus.com/products/daily-moisture/eucerin-daily-protection-spf-15-moisturizing-body-lotion.html">Eucerin&#8217;s Daily Protection</a> lotion. Both have an SPF of 15, which is perfect for a normal day of running errands and shuttling kids around. Cover your whole body, every morning; reapply to hands every time you wash during the day. And don&#8217;t forget your neck (back and front) and your ears &#8212; they need protection, too. Right after the dermatologist sliced part of my nose off today he froze two spots, on my hand and my ear. Neither was cancerous, but both had the potential. Lotion up, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>Be smart about application.</strong> I&#8217;m sure you know that you need to reapply sunscreen every two hours, at least, but did you know that you need to put your sunscreen on 30 minutes before you even go out in the sun? Because yes, you do. And did you know that lotion is a better base than spray? Because it is. For the best protection, lotion up (the average adult needs one ounce, or about a shot glass full, of lotion to completely cover everything) and then follow up every hour you&#8217;re outside with spray. The exception: Don&#8217;t use spray sunscreen on your face. For obvious reasons. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really, <em>really</em> serious about staying skin cancer free, wear a hat and sunglasses, and opt for clothes that cover your arms and legs. Or do what I do and get comfy in the shade. It&#8217;s the best place to spend the summer. I promise. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[I've found the perfect working mom handbag: the Joni Hobo from Ellington Handbags.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a funny thing about being the mom of bigger kids: You get your handbag back. Once your kids are school-age (mine are in third and fifth grade this year), you&#8217;re no longer responsible for carrying all their junk around all day &#8212; that&#8217;s what school bags are for! Plus tweens just don&#8217;t seem to need so much junk; my kid who always, <em>always</em> had to take eleventy toys with him on the road when he was little (seriously, he carried a pile of I don&#8217;t know what all stuff with him every time we left the house, all the way through kindergarten, you all) now carries nothing. In fact, he doesn&#8217;t even wear a coat most of the time, which is a whole other thing that I am refusing to think about. I&#8217;m just glad it was warm here this winter.</p>
<p>But the point is, my bag is <em>my bag</em> these days. Not the bag I carry to hold all of the boys&#8217; things. And it is delightful. </p>
<p>Because of this change, I find that a whole new world of handbags has opened up for me. I can <a href="http://workingcloset.com/2011/11/30/goodbye-big-bag/">carry a clutch for day</a>, which I love to do because it&#8217;s easy and chic &#8212; but it also means that if I&#8217;m going any place where I want to bring my iPad, I have to lug that separately. And that&#8217;s a pain. But I&#8217;m also really over my huge tote bags, the ones that were big enough to carry extra diapers and sippy cups and changes of clothes and superhero action figures and LEGOs and &#8230; you know the drill. I don&#8217;t need that bag any more. I need the perfect Goldilocks in-between bag.</p>
<p>And you all, I have found it! And it is beautiful.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/7051211807/" title="49c104325d9c11e19896123138142014_7 by Susan Wagner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7087/7051211807_fa3d55b1bb.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="49c104325d9c11e19896123138142014_7"></a></p>
<p><span id="more-629"></span>This is the <a href="http://www.ellingtonhandbags.com/Home_2/ECO-Style/Joni-Hobo-Tan">Joni Hobo, from Ellington Handbags</a>. I&#8217;m a huge fan of Ellington&#8217;s bags; they are beautifully crafted and thoughtfully designed, and the materials are always lovely. The Joni is a pebbled leather that just a little big rugged; it works perfectly with the metal hardware and visible stitching on the bag&#8217;s front.</p>
<p>But as much as I love the look of this bag, it&#8217;s the function that really won me over. The Joni is a sleek, structured hobo &#8212; nothing slouchy about this bag. It has a single strap, which makes it easy to carry (nothing is falling off your shoulder when you&#8217;re wrangling groceries or an umbrella, for instance). It also has plenty of well-organized space for all the things you need to go from the office to karate or little league or a dinner date with the girls. I use the two outside pockets to hold my phone and my sunglasses; the other exterior side of the bag has a long zippered pocket that&#8217;s perfect for storing cash or receipts &#8212; anything you&#8217;re putting away on the fly but don&#8217;t want to drop to the bottom of the big bag.  </p>
<p>The inside of this bag has three slip pockets that are just the right size for my wallet and keys and lip gloss. And because those inside pockets are high up, near the bag&#8217;s opening, there&#8217;s no more fumbling around in the bottom of my bag for my debit card. That right there makes this bag a winner.</p>
<p>The Joni is the perfect size for my iPad (it&#8217;s a little small for my MacBook, although I can make it work in an emergency &#8212; but this is not the bag for you if you&#8217;re carrying a laptop everywhere). It has a fairly slim profile (it&#8217;s only 4 inches deep) but there&#8217;s enough interior room for everything I need during the day (small makeup pouch, tissue, hand lotion, scarf, bottle of water). The pebbled leather makes this bag casual enough to be an everyday mom bag, while the sleek styling makes it appropriate for work. It truly is the perfect day bag.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ellingtonhandbags.com/Home_2/ECO-Style/Joni-Hobo-Tan">Joni Hobo</a> comes in tan (pictured), red, brown and black; it&#8217;s made of Ellington&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ellingtonhandbags.com/Signature-Materials">Pebbled Eco Leather</a> and lined with their signature printed cotton. The Joni retails for $229, but Ellington is currently offering free standard shipping for a limited time. </p>
<p>And during the month of April, Ellington will donate 20% of the purchase price of every Joni Hobo to the Sierra Club. Excellent.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrea has a fantastic dilemma: &#8220;I won a pair of free shoes on DSW and <a href="http://www.dsw.com/shoe/js+by+jessica+oscar+suede+pump?prodId=dsw12prod3750075&amp;productRef=SEARCH">I picked these</a> (I don&#8217;t have any colorful shoes so I thought these looked &#8216;fun&#8217;). I&#8217;m just at a complete loss on how to style them. Opinions?&#8221;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/6872065096/" title="Screen shot 2012-03-26 at 12.14.41 PM by Susan Wagner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7185/6872065096_6d9aba268a.jpg" width="478" height="319" alt="Screen shot 2012-03-26 at 12.14.41 PM"></a></p>
<p>First of all, hooray for free shoes! And those shoes really are fun. <em>Love</em> them. Great choice, Andrea.<br />
<span id="more-627"></span><br />
Bright colored shoes can seem daunting, but they&#8217;re really easy to style. Andrea can pair these with a pair of skinny jeans or slim cropped trousers or with a long pair of trouser jeans for a colorful edge to a casual outfit. She can also wear them with a skirt, one that hits at or just below the knee. </p>
<p>Andrea should think about the shoes in the same way she would with any other colored accessory. She can wear them with neutral basics (a gray skirt, a navy dress) or with other complimentary colors (yellow or orange). These pumps would be amazing with a pair of bright blue skinny jeans or a kelly green skirt.</p>
<p>A couple of don&#8217;ts &#8212; Andrea shouldn&#8217;t match her bag to her shoes, or her jewelry (although she could pick up the coral shade in a bracelet or earrings, as long as she keeps it subtle). She also shouldn&#8217;t wear these shoes with a very short skirt or shorts. But I probably didn&#8217;t have to say that, did i?</p>
<p><strong>Your turn &#8212; how would you style a bright pair of pumps or flats? Are you a fan of colorful shoes, or are you a neutral girl?</strong></p>

But anything I think might be workable at some level is harder for me -- even if I'm struggling to find the solution. So the striped blazer lingers in my closet while I ruthlessly edit the rest of my wardrobe.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been cleaning my closet out for weeks now, slowly weeding out all the pieces I don&#8217;t wear. For the most part, I have no second thoughts about what I&#8217;ve put in the giveaway pile, but there&#8217;s one jacket &#8212; a navy and white striped jersey blazer &#8212; that I keep taking out and putting back in and taking out and &#8230;</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/6844792830/" title="11116|00005db30|968d_orh750w480_1212-1019 by Susan Wagner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7199/6844792830_9e3b268674.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="11116|00005db30|968d_orh750w480_1212-1019"></a></p>
<p>I bought the jacket last summer, on a whim; I loved the idea of the striped blazer, and it&#8217;s super cute and fits really well. And I&#8217;ve never worn it because it doesn&#8217;t go with anything in my closet. I&#8217;m not sure why; the waist seems to be in the wrong place or something. All I know is that every time I put it on, it looks silly. But it&#8217;s cute and it&#8217;s in my closet and I am totally determined to make it work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like that about things &#8212; not just my clothes, either. Even when I can see that a project or a job isn&#8217;t going the way I had anticipated, I&#8217;m loath to quit, because I made the commitment and I&#8217;m always sure I can make it work. Even when I&#8217;m also pretty sure I can&#8217;t.<br />
<span id="more-626"></span></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/6990918713/" title="11116|00005db2f|99ca_orh750w480_1212-1018 by Susan Wagner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7203/6990918713_b7675e66a5.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="11116|00005db2f|99ca_orh750w480_1212-1018"></a></p>
<p>I had taken the jacket out of the closet, again, and then I saw these photos of Gwyneth Paltrow, in a campaign for the Swedish brand <a href="http://www.lindex.com/eu/?countryUnknown">Lindex</a>. The clothes are classic and Preppie and look a lot like pieces I already own &#8212; and in with all the other things I&#8217;m already wearing,  there&#8217;s the blazer! Just like mine! And paired with pieces I already own! Maybe <em>that</em> was how to make it work.</p>
<p>So I gave it one more try.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/6844792756/" title="11116|00005db2b|ded1_orh750w480_1212-1014 by Susan Wagner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7052/6844792756_65b28d3652.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="11116|00005db2b|ded1_orh750w480_1212-1014"></a></p>
<p>When I know something isn&#8217;t working, I have no trouble giving it up. But anything I think might be workable at some level is harder for me &#8212; even if I&#8217;m struggling to find the solution. So the striped blazer lingers in my closet while I ruthlessly edit the rest of my wardrobe.</p>
<p>Yesterday, trying once again to make the blazer work, I had a light bulb moment: All this closet cleaning isn&#8217;t about my closet at all. This ongoing wardrobe purge is about other things in my life that I can&#8217;t seem to make work. I have too many commitments right now, and while they&#8217;re all good opportunities, not all of them are working for me. But just like the blazer, I keep thinking that I&#8217;m bound to find a way to make everything come together. </p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayplaydate/6844792928/" title="11116|00005db2d|6773_orh750w480_1212-1016 by Susan Wagner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7193/6844792928_d6be420032.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="11116|00005db2d|6773_orh750w480_1212-1016"></a><br />
<em>What would Gwyneth do? She would stick to what works for her, that&#8217;s what.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m giving up the jacket &#8212; for real this time &#8212; and I&#8217;m dropping a few of my commitments as well. And cleaning off my desk because it&#8217;s making me crazy. And I&#8217;ll probably get rid of a few more things in my closet, because that makes me feel like I&#8217;m in control. </p>
<p><strong>What do you do when you&#8217;re feeling overwhelmed? Do you shop or clean or lose yourself in all of season two of &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221;? Dish in the comments. (I&#8217;ll bet Gwyneth does yoga &#8212; and then goes home and has a glass or three of wine. Just a guess.)</strong></p>

<p>Lori is having a bag dilemma.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m in grad school, so I regularly have books, notebooks, and papers to take to campus. For that, I bought the <a href="http://www.ellingtonhandbags.com/?search=eva%20messenger">Ellington Eva Messenger bag</a>. I have a more industrial messenger bag from LL Bean for days I have a lot of books to carry. I bring my lunch because I&#8217;m on campus all day. Lunch isn&#8217;t going to fit in my Eva bag. I also carry a purse because I generally need that smaller bag for running those inevitable errands and it transitions me from campus to off-campus. My purse has my wallet, on-the-go makeup-y things (chapstick, lipstick, mirror, handkerchief, nail file, spare hair ties and pins), mints, a small notebook, my planner, some pens. I&#8217;m one of those nerds who makes it a requirement that my purses can fit a book, so most of my purses are mid-sized, but not HUGE.  Naturally, I feel ridiculous carrying a messenger bag, lunchbox, and a purse.  Do you have any sort of suggestions? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a matter of reassessing and reorganizing, but everything feels vital to me. An outsider&#8217;s opinion would probably help.</em></p>
<p>This is a pretty common dilemma; when we leave the house, we feel like we need to take everything with us, all the time, because we never know what we might need, right? Here&#8217;s the thing: men manage to go all day without carrying six bags. What do they know that we don&#8217;t? </p>
<p>They know what to leave behind. Simple.<br />
<span id="more-625"></span><br />
Instead of packing a bag that could take you through a week in the Himalayas every time you leave the house, think about taking only what you will actually need while you are away from home. How do you know what you need? Pay attention to what you actually take out of your bag and use, for an entire week. I used to carry half a dozen lip glosses with me everywhere I went &#8212; and then one day I realized that I was only ever wearing one of them. The other five live in my makeup bag now, and I swap them in and out &#8212; one at a time &#8212; according to my mood. </p>
<p>Paring down means planning for specific worst case scenarios, rather than preparing for every possible problem. I always have a couple of tampons in my bag (because you never know when those will come in handy &#8212; seriously) but honestly, only a couple; I can replenish my stock if those two get used up. Also, there&#8217;s a Walgreens on every corner where I live, for a real emergency. Think about what can live in your car, rather than your bag (extra hair ties, for example) and what you can just live without (a mirror).</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve weeded out some of the small things, look for ways to make your technology work for you to help eliminate the bigger things. Instead of carrying a separate paper planner, use your smartphone &#8212; you can transfer appointments or notes to your planner when you get home. I&#8217;ve stopped carrying my laptop with me to conferences and meetings &#8212; instead, I take my iPad, which is lighter and easier to tote. I use the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8">Penultimate app</a> to take notes; I have an inexpensive stylus so I can write rather than trying to type, which works better for me. A tablet computer &#8212; or even a laptop &#8212; will take up less space in Lori&#8217;s bag than separate notebooks; she can still organize her notes by class or subject without dragging all that extra paper. My friend Rachel uses a wireless keyboard with her iPad, which is a terrific solution if typing is your thing. </p>
<p>But what about the purse/lunchbox dilemma? I say ditch them both. Opt for a simple structured carrier for lunch &#8212; the <a href="http://store.uturn2tap.com/products/%22MUNCHBOX%22-stainless-steel-lunchbox-with-inner-container.html">Munchbox</a> is the perfect size and shape for a messenger bag &#8212; and consolidate everything from the purse into a sleek wallet or clutch (I like <a href="http://www.eshakti.com/Product/CL0022966/Color-club-bow-wristlet">eShakti&#8217;s bow wristlet</a>). The bottom line is to pack like a guy: only take what you need, make your tech work for you, and don&#8217;t worry about the stuff you&#8217;re leaving at home.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in the middle of a huge closet clean out; I want to be able to go into my closet and see only <a href="http://workingcloset.com/2012/02/14/wear-what-you-love/">pieces I love</a>. I also want to see only pieces that easily work together. That&#8217;s not too much to ask, is it?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>Conventional closet cleaning advice recommends dividing everything into a keep pile, a giveaway pile and a pile that needs attention &#8212; either dry cleaning or tailoring. Dry cleaning is easy; you just have to commit to taking things to the cleaners. Tailoring can be more of a mystery &#8212; you know something doesn&#8217;t fit right, but how do you know if it can be fixed?<br />
<span id="more-624"></span><br />
The first rule of tailoring is that it&#8217;s always easier to make something smaller than it is to make it bigger. If you&#8217;re considering buying a dress or skirt or pair of pants and having them let out, think twice; instead, opt for a larger size, even if that size is a little big. You&#8217;ll have better luck having the too-big garment taken in than you will having the too-small garment let out. I promise. </p>
<p>Some alterations are simple; you can have a hem shortened without much trouble, for example. (Or, if you&#8217;re dealing with a straight hem, you can DIY it with some <a href="http://www.joann.com/heat-n-bond-hem-fusible-web-tape-3-8-w-3-4-w/prd48914/">iron-on hem tape</a> &#8212; that&#8217;s what I do, but don&#8217;t tell my tailor.) Sleeves are also simple to shorten (on a jacket, for example) and most of the time, it&#8217;s easy to pull the waist in on a garment.</p>
<p>Shortening the rise on a pair of pants, though, is nearly impossible &#8212; if the waist of your pants fits by the crotch falls too low, you&#8217;re stuck with it. Those pants probably just need to go; they don&#8217;t fit right and cannot be saved. The same is true for pants with a rise that is too short &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing your tailor can do to fix that. Sorry. </p>
<p>You can take the waist in on a pair of pants, but only if the pants are no more than two sizes too big &#8212; anything beyond that and the alteration will ruin the line of the pants. Think of it this way: If you&#8217;re suddenly down more than two pants sizes, you deserve to go shopping. Seriously.</p>
<p>A dress can be taken in through the mid section, but again, if it&#8217;s more than two sizes too big, the alterations may dramatically change the line of the dress. And when you take in the middle, be sure to have your tailor assess how that will affect the top of the dress; pulling in the waist on a sheath dress, for example, changes the way the dress fits under the arms, which can do bad things to the armholes.</p>
<p>Can you get by without taking things to a tailor? Sure &#8212; belts are great if you&#8217;re talking about pieces that are almost the right size but not quite, and you can do a lot with hem tape and a needle and thread. But for structured garments, or anything that was a real investment (a suit, say, or a beautiful pair of wool trousers) you need to trust a professional. And you need to recognize that not everything can be salvaged by the tailor. </p>
