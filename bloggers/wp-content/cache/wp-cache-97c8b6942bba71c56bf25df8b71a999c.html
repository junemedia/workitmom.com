		<description>Can we choose them all?  As a working mom with a 1 year old, I'm usually the first one up in the morning (gotta shower before the baby gets up) and the last to bed (how come laundry can only get done in the middle of the night?).  My partner and I split the days off we need for sick baby days, but because I only have 5 vacation days and no sick time each year, I take the days unpaid while he can arrange to work from home.  Luckily my son has just started sleeping through the night, so I'm working on catching up on the year of sleep I lost nursing him 2-3 times a night for the last year!</description>

		<description>Great topic for a post! My husband says he helps, yet I earn the majority of our income with the added bonus of doing 90% of the school drop-offs and pick ups. My vacation days are used for family emergencies; his for golf. This clearly limits my career - as in a competitive workplace, there are all of these mysterious 4:30 PM meetings that pop up at the last minute when I can't be there. I know my son will get older, and getting him a good start in life is the most important thing I can do. However, I dream of when he is old enough to not need someone around 24/7 - then I will sleep for more than 4 hours a night, excercise a bit more, lose the 15 pounds that I've gained since my son was two.</description>

		<description>I wrote my MBA thesis on this very topic a few years ago. In 2002, the very few women who made it to the corner office of Fortune 500 companies did not have children of their own, either marrying men with children from previous marriages or choosing not to have children at all. In contrast, men in the corner office almost always had children (and wives who stayed at home). Additionally, women with children often have their dedication to their work questioned when they leave the office to attend functions or care for a sick child, whereas men are practically applauded when they leave the office to attend a sports match or school play.

My hypothesis when I began working on this project was that women in the workplace have it much easier now than they did 50 years ago. Sadly, after all my research, I concluded that my initial ideas were wrong: the workplace is just as difficult for women now (if not more so) as it has ever been, and the notion of successfully raising a family and landing that corner office executive position is still very much a pipe dream.</description>
