		<description>The responses from the kids cracked me up...I love you let us read their honest (and so spot on) takes on the food they eat. It's such a great thing that you listen to them when they talk about food. Not a lot of people do, gourmet or not. 

And really, you can never go wrong with bacon...Canadian or otherwise...</description>

		<description>One thought if the lentil flavor is too strong for your family is to substitute a different kind of legume.  I bet that small white beans or even pigeon peas - both of which have a milder flavor - would be equally good in this.  Personally I love lentils, but I know lots of people who don't.</description>

		<description>A rice cooker is absolutely the best invention.  You put in the rice and water, press a button, and it stops when the rice is done, 20-ish minutes later.  Perfect rice every time.  Throw the cooking bowl in the dishwasher.  You can get a 3 or 6 cup model  from Target for $15.</description>

		<description>Yum, looks totally delicious and my family would gobble it up.  I'll have to give it a try.  Straight up lentils don't do it here but when I jazz them up...thanks for the idea!</description>

		<description>Whoa!  I just clicked over to Rachael Ray's site and no wonder your basmati got burned!  Her directions are whack -- about 10 minutes too long on the cooking time, not enough water, and I'd also suggest low heat, not medium-low (my stove dials go from 1-10, and I do rice a little past 2).  If you're interested in doing basmati again you might try this:
1 3/4 cups water 
1 cup Basmati rice 
In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. 
For a little color you could also stir in 1/2 cup frozen peas after the rice is done cooking.  (Let sit about 5 minutes for the peas to warm up)</description>

		<description>Being a bona fide picky eater, married to one even pickier, and raising the pickiest, I ask this: can you substitute regular bacon? Canadian bacon is too hammy for me. Me no likey the ham.</description>

		<description>Yes, I did. Ok, good idea re using canned lentils. So they should be pretty soft when they are ready, right?</description>

		<description>I think it looks pretty good. My son wouldn't like the whole tomatoes, but I'm thinking they could be diced. 

I like that you have added this to a new place. COOL BEANS!!!</description>
