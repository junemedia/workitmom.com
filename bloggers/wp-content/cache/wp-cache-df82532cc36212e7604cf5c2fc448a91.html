		<description>Some may find it lonely at the top. Sitting succesful in an office on the 10th floor with a view of the ocean can be a woman's dream or it can be the loneliest time of her life. The key is balance and delegation. 
Go home take off the suit, put on some jeans and T-shirt. Define boundaries and  have fun. Allocate time for your mate, time for your kids and grab a little time for yourself and remain well defined. Outsource yard work,  house cleaning. Join a health club with children's activities. Take public transportation to work to catch up. Try to do as much as a family as possible. Have dinner together, ride bikes, go to church. The key is moderation and balance.  Activities that absorb family time should be evaluated. Again, balance creates stability. Maintain perspective. Humans are social creatures and thrive as a family.</description>

		<description>Being a single mom is what drove me in my career.  I needed to make it on my own so that I knew I didn't have to rely on someone to raise my son.

I haven't run into single mom's at work in exec positions, but I have certainly found many that are highly successful with no kids.  Many are divorced or on second marriages.

I truly believe you can't have it all.  But, I'll try hard to almost have it all.  

Nataly - I feel for you having to take a question like that from an investor.  And a woman.  When are we all going to support each other rather than competing or being negative with each other.</description>

		<description>It is different. Some women marry men who doesnt want their wives to be more successful or have a higher pay. Some women start thinking less of the man they married because of the advancement of their career. It needs to be a balance.</description>

		<description>i have so been on both sides of this!  I have had a woman manager tell me YES TELL ME that if i wanted to succeed in my career i should get divorced.  this is when i realized she was crazy!  My husband is completely supportive of my career and one of the rare ones that doesnt really mind that i make the money.  The hard part is teaching him to take care of the house ... 

Now i work for a company where two of the VPs that I know personally are both happily in their first (and only) marriages.  One has 2 kids and the other has 5.  yes, FIVE kids!  

I think the executive level women have a distinct advantage over middle managers because the pay check is usually high enough that you can hire someone to clean the house and mow the lawn - this then allows you enough time to spend with your family.  Getting to that point, however, is the challenge!  (i am just realizing as i write this that maybe i can put up with the mess for a couple of more years and make the leap to afford a cleaning person!!  it would certainly help the marriage!)</description>

		<description>I have to say that I see this much less in the nonprofit world, where I work. I also see more women in leadership positions. Of course, we make less money...</description>

		<description>Good morning, All.  I love this topic.  This has always been a struggle for me until recently.  I have to say that when I was a single mom, I was always a manager.  I remember all the blood, sweat, and tears.  When I was married to my first husband, it was financially straining, but none the less, I had the luxury of being a stay at home mom.  So, working full time with 3 babies was so impossible to me.  I worked crazy hours all the time.  50-60 per week.  Sleep?  I had forgotten what that was like.  My kids were potty trained by daycare, daycare taught them how to tie their shoes, and so many other things that I missed out on as a mommy.  

Now, more than ever, I want to be at home with my kids.  I don't want to miss anymore dance recitals or games.  I am also newly married after being single for 10 years.  Huge changes!!!  I don't want to miss out on my husband, either.  He is wonderful to me and my kids.  He would do anything for us.

Fortunately, there is a light at the end of the tunnel for me.  I have recently started working out of my home and I am on my way out of my 9-5 job.  My husband and kids are so proud of me.  I have had to make sacrifices in the last month, by in another month or two, I will not have to make those sacrifices anymore.

I am forever grateful!!!  Have a great day, everyone!</description>

		<description>This is interesting, because it's something I've thought about for years. I left the film business because all the power women around me were either separated or on their way to getting divorced. I was a newlywed, saw the warning signs and recharted my career.

Now, 8 years into marriage, I see that the issue stems from my drive. I have a hard time putting everyone else's needs first. I have a goal, I know what I want in 5, 10, 15 years. I am so close to achieving my career goals I can almost taste it.

Do I also have a goal to raise well-adjusted proper adults? Absolutely. Do I worry that I will forever put my own desires first and ultimately eff my kids up? Completely. 

Do I think that my career drive alienates my partner and causes him to resent me? Oh good lord yes. Would I stop, put it all on hold if it meant a happy marriage? I don't think I could.

All I know is that I can't stop hurtling forwards. All I can do is make myself happy and hope that no one gets hurt on the way up.</description>

		<description>Your story here reminds me of The Devil Wears Prada. Quite literally, the queen bee of the company describes going through multiple divorces and being a single mom while the main character decides to quit because it's ruining her relationship with her boyfriend. I can see where this is very common. Career driven women probably make their male counterparts feel inferior and we all know that men need to feel like they are the head of the family.

I, personally, choose my daughter and my hubby over any job that would require the majority of my time and efforts. I make enough and, in fact, make a good bit more than my hubby. I only work 40 hour weeks and I do have the option of overtime but in my job, the work isn't going anywhere. The deadlines are far enough out that we might as well take our time. Having my daughter and hubby are way more important than that job.

I DO think women can do all 3. They might need to have the 'stay-at-home-dad' situation, but I just can't see why it would be out of the question.

Nataly, I wouldn't let that woman intimidate you. Just because SHE can't do it all doesn't mean you can't. I've been a part of this site for a good while now and I think you have nothing to worry about.</description>
