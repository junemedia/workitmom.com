		<description>Excellent point!! Make sure you take some of the "vacation" time to sit in a bathtub and relax, or better yet, by your new POOL! :)</description>

		<description>So true.  Vacations are recharge time for body, brain and soul.  So many years went by before I figured that out.  

I admit that I worked to finish up a project two days after my extremely premature daughter was born.   I'd already been unexpectedly away for four days (in labor) and had a client who didn't understand.  &lt;i&gt;But we didn't even know you were pregnant!  We need this now!&lt;/i&gt;   If it were today's me rather than that year's me, I would have given him a piece of my mind, not a promise to get his artwork delivered tomorrow.</description>

		<description>I think this is one of the hardest things about working for yourself. My father offered to come and babysit tonight while my husband and I go to a movie and I actually thought about saying no - nights are my second shift - before I realized that I was insane to not say thank you!</description>

		<description>I just took a week off to move, including five days with NO INTERNET CONNECTION, and the hardest thing about it was wondering how on earth I would ever get back into the work groove again.  And then on Monday morning, I woke up and turned on the computer and picked up where I left off.

I only wish I had given myself permission ahead of time to NOT WORK for that week, instead of constantly thinking RIGHT AFTER I UNPACK THESE TWENTY BOXES I WILL GET SOME WORK DONE.</description>
