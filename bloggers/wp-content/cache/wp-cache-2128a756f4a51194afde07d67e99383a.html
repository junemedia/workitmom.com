		<description>Nataly, 

Great post! 

My list has morphed into my own version of a to do list. I used to use a planner but my issue with the one that I had was there wasn't enough room on it for "my notes". And then I could have gotten another one (bigger) but then it would be too heavy. Now, I use a spiral notebook to list out my daily to do lists however, I use the Franklin Covey method of prioritizing these tasks. The BIGGEST move for me was to only put down the 6 things I would like accomplish for the day. IF and only if I complete those 6 things, do I add more tasks for that day. This way, I have a greater sense of accomplishment because I have completed those things I really wanted to get done AND most of the time more than that.

I agree with Nataly and Kim about writing things down. I am not sure what it is about writing my things to do but it seems to work best for me as well.  I also carry around a recorder ($20 at Staples) to help me remember things to put on my list. This works well when I am out in my car especially. 

As Heather mentioned, she scopes out the "big rocks" and then that helps. I use  the Franklin Covey "system" for prioritizing tasks of placing A, B, C. A is for those things that you can't put off, REALLY. Your boss will fire you or your client will be upset with you if you don't. B is for those things you would like to get done. C is for those things that can wait. Most of the time I don't really have any C's on my pages. If I don't have to do them that day...I just don't add them.  And then I take each set of A's, B's and then mark them 1,2,3, etc.

As Layla pointed out, giving yourself time without worrying about work such as a massage, or a haircut, chilling out with a magazine, hot bath....be sure to SCHEDULE time for YOU. 

Sincerely,

		<description>One of my favorite points on your list is the "1 Thing I will do for me this week". One of the most important things I do for "Me" time is get a massage. Balancing my work schedule with my kids' schedules and attending to the duties of household life can often be overwhelming, and a day at the spa is very balancing.  I'm from NJ and there's this wonderful place I just discovered called Massage Envy (I highly recommend it to any working NJ moms out there!) I think that while planning and task lists are essential to a succesful week, allow yourself to forget all that during one hour of deep-tissue bliss.</description>

		<description>I am adopting a plan called "Zen to Done", developed by Leo Babuota of the Zen Habits blog. One thing I do is write out the "Big Rocks" (in other words, the most important items) that need to get done during the week (up to 6 things, that's the tricky part!) Then I stake out time in my calendar when I'll attend to those things. Then each day I come up with 1-3 "most important tasks" to do (some of them are the weekly big rocks) and try to do them as early as possible. This helps me prioritize and it also helps me reflect back on the day or week and see success. If I get more done than the big rocks and most important tasks, that's great. Since my weakness is seeing all tasks as super-important, this method helps me decide what to let go of and what to keep.</description>

		<description>Oh yes, I use my daily planner Moleskine every day. I never go to work without it. I use my PDA, but nothing beats the feeling of writing something down or sketching out my plan in thumbanils for the week.</description>

		<description>My husband is the list maker for our family.  Every Sunday he makes out the list and divides stuff up and hands me my section.  I do my own list for work of course.  He's not that nice!</description>
