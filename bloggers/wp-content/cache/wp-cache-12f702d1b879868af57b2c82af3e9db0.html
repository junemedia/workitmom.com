		<description>I love this article!!!  Way to consolidate such a potentially endless topic into a few paragraphs- seriously.  I have finally resigned myself to realizing that more is just more most of the time.  I found your blog a few weeks ago when you were doing your "fast" from consumerism and it inspired me to do the same.  Ever since I've had a much more clear picture of self and how I want to portray my gorgeousness.  I added a phenomenal pair of El Naturalista shoes to my wardrobe this weekend and instead of feeling mortified at spending the $100 mega-sale price, I felt completely confident that they would be the best compliment to my newly realized style.  

And for the record, I think you would look adorable in above outfit.  Those shorts make me cry, too, because I do not have legs that I'd like to bare in that manner!</description>

		<description>wow i needed to hear this:  "...it is important to identify you style, both your current style and your fantasy style..."

i often have a 'fantasy' style but never quite get there, mostly because i do at least know what styles look good on me... just now have to figure out how to make it a cohesive style and bring in a little 'trend' here and there!  pants and blouses are really not that exciting... i want a little excitement!</description>
