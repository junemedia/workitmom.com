		<description>I've heard the Dyson Animal vacuum is worth the cost but I don't have any experience with the vacuum.  I don't like carpet and only have carpet in my bedroom but if I had my way I'd rip that out.  I use an old old Rainbow vacuum.  LOL</description>

		<description>After doing a lot of research – what I found out was so alarming! Expensive face creams have so many chemicals in it, that in the long run – it is probably not causing any benefits for my skin!  AND, they don’t contain any extraordinary ingredients – you can actually find the majority of ingredients can be found in CVS-Brand Moisturizers. 

This drove me nuts.

For now with great results, I am using the Vitamin Enhanced Face Firming Serum, from the Made from Earth product line, and I love the results I am seeing.  I did research on all the ingredients and all of it is positive.  I also now only use skin care that is organic ingredients .  I have been using it for 1 month now, and this Vitamin Enhanced Face Firming Serum has already made m face tighter and firmer. 

Highly recommended – their website is www.madefromearth.com</description>

		<description>I bought into the hype of the Dyson and I thought it worked great until I found something that really blew me away! It's called the Rainbow. It uses water to clean the air and the rest of my home. After I saw an in-home demonstration and compared it side-by-side with my Dyson. I immediately quit using the Dyson and bought the Rainbow. My home is cleaner, my air is cleaner, and my family and guests are no longer bothered by their allergies when they are here. Having several fur-shedding pets makes my Rainbow even more welcome in my home because it picks up all of the hair and pet dander!</description>

		<description>Ladies, the La Mer really works. I live in Brazil in a tropical island. Sun and wind are my friends here and La Mer is the best. I'm 36 and nobody tells, to be honest, nobody believes I'm over 30. I never thought I would ever trust in an expansive product like this one but, it works. My skin looks clear and soft as a baby.</description>

		<description>OK, ladies, save your Starbuck's money and drop the big bucks for the Creme de La Mer.  It makes my skin look like a child's.  No luck with any of their auxilliary products (thank God -- I don't have to buy those too!), but the cream is beyond sensational.  Totally worth it.</description>

		<description>I wanted the Dyson but bought the Kirby that is expensive. I don't think the Dyson is expensive but I have a friend that has the dyson and I love hers particularly because the Kirby is REALLY heavy. 

God Bless

		<description>After my son was born, I wanted to stay home to raise him. If was so hard to shrink budget and life style of 2 incomes to one. We kept accumulating more and more debt. I knew I had to something. I wanted to work from my house, so I can be with my baby, but also help my husband financially.
It wasn’t easy to land true opportunity. There is a lot of fraud out there. I tried to get into stuffing envelopes, filling out surveys, secret shopper.... Nothing legit....until...
Now I have my home business and I am part of this great company! The most important thing is that I work from home and am with my family. With great support and online training, I got everything I needed to achieve my financial goals and dreams with this proven business model.

		<description>I'm with Sara on the Miele vacuum. I haven't tried the Dyson, but the Miele is awesome. It's also so quiet that my cat doesn't even leave the room when I turn it on. Shocking.

As for the LaMer, I use it, yes I do. But I do think the lotion is better than the creme, unless you have very very dry skin. I really really love the lotion. If you start feeling like $140 for lotion is too expensive, head to the La Prairie counter and price theirs. Yow. Anyway, I like the creme as an eye cream, and when you use it like that it's almost cheap because, um, it's giant for a jar of eye cream. Definitely ask for a sample - they will so give you one.</description>

		<description>i finally tried LeMer face cream, gave it to myself as a gift...i'm good at that...as expected it is okay but not sensational. have not seen any  miracles yet, but i'm only through half the jar. so still time i guess. the gel version of the product may be nicer, i bought the original one which you massage into your hands, then press onto your face. LeMer is actually NOT the most expensive face moisturizer out there, there are ones quite a bit higher. I'm glad i satisfied my curiosity, but probably would not buy it again. i did, however, get a sample of Natura Bisse glyco extreme peel, i would buy this!!! sample has lasted a long time &#38; now peeks my interest in the rest of their product line. thanks!!</description>
