Take Care

		<description>Sounds yummy to me! I love cauliflower!

And WHERE did you find your baking dish??? My grandmother used to have a whole set of bakeware like that with the vegetables on the side and she used them all the time. I'd love to have a few dishes like them!</description>

		<description>I'm with software mom - I do copy and paste it into a word document - but I do wish you would have a printer friendly version (whine, whine, whine - it's all about me!)

I will try this.  My whole family loves roast cauliflower - I cut it up and just toss it w/olive oil, garlic and salt and bake - but I have a hard time getting the temp and timing right.  But my 8, 6 and 3 yr old love it to the point where we fight over the last couple of bites of one head.

thanks for sharing</description>

		<description>Heh, I already do the copy/paste-to-a-word-document thing (as now I feel like the smug teacher's pet).

I usually don't do sides out of sheer laziness, but occasionally feel up to branching out.  Next time I do, I'll have to try this one.</description>

		<description>Every time I try to visit your Trenches site, it comes up with an "owner has exceeded her bandwidth" msg. :( 
I miss my fix!!

&lt;strong&gt;Chris says: Yes I exceeded my monthly bandwidth.  But once  midnight hits, it should all be working again.  Hopefully.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>
