Several cameramen jockey for position. Those of us who have been sitting at Gate C2 for an hour, waiting to depart, wonder whom the news teams are expecting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The airline personnel seem to know what’s up. Every few minutes, they offer the news teams an update: <em>They’re in range. The plane’s in range. Any minute now.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another passenger notices that I am scrutinizing the situation, like she is. She sidles over to me. “Who are they waiting for?” she asks me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“I was trying to figure that out myself,” I said</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other passengers approach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Do you know?&#8221; &#8220;Have they said?&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“No, we’re all wondering.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A diverted flight, a hijacker? A politician? A celebrity, A- or D-list?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our flight has finally been listed as delayed. This is not exactly news to the growing crowd at C2. What we want to know is who&#8217;s due to arrive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A young African-American cameraman to my right is explaining the excitement. I strain to hear his words: “A little girl from the <a href="http://www.wish.org/about">Make-a-Wish Foundation</a>. She’s going to the Saratoga Ballet.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;What did he just say?&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I feel dirty passing along the information. This is no Lindsay Lohan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8230;she&#8217;s a little girl&#8230;from the Make-a-Wish Foundation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The woman who first approached me bites her lip. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I nod.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The woman&#8217;s daughter trots over. “Who is it?” she asks us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Come, let’s go back to our seats,&#8221; says the woman.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span id="more-398"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;But who is it?&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;It’s a little girl from the Make-a-Wish Foundation,” she tells her daughter. “We don’t need to stare. We shouldn’t stare.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Because she&#8217;s sick. She&#8217;s very sick.&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;I just know.&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I can&#8217;t help but look when the guest of honor arrives through Gate C2. Almost everyone in Albany Airport&#8217;s Terminal C is looking. The TV crews surround her, but the newscasters seem confused, unsure that they&#8217;ve got the right girl. Their faces say: <em>She doesn&#8217;t look sick.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">She is absolutely lovely. She is beaming. Sandy-blonde hair, a ponytail, freckles, tall, maybe 11 or 12. She&#8217;s accompanied by her mother and possibly an older sister. She clutches a garment bag to her chest and grins, her face flushed with excitement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The newscasters push to engage the girl in conversation. Clearly, she&#8217;d been alerted that the local news would be waiting, but the size of the crowd staring at Gate C2 is surprising by any standards.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At one anchorwoman&#8217;s request, the girl carefully unveils her prized garment: a pink, froufy cocktail dress that presumably she will be wearing tonight, to the ballet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I hear the questions:<em> How long have you been sick? How long have you had this dream? Have you missed a lot of school?</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I cringe at the insipid inquiries, but she fields all the questions like a pro. I hurt for her mother and strain to see her expression, but the crowd is blocking her. I can see the girl&#8217;s older sister, standing a little off to the side, a mixed expression on her face: protectiveness, concern, pride.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A flash goes off, and the young girl loses her focus. She looks past the cameras, past her mom and her sister, and unexpectedly meets my eye.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I see, for a second, the tiredness behind the excitement: a moment of bewilderment. I smile reflexively, the same smile I would give to one of my own daughters. <em>You can do it. You&#8217;re doing fine.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">She composes herself and retrains her focus on the newscasters. Her older sister is no longer smiling. She looks worried, and casts a quick glance from her sister to her mother.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is the kind of thing that is beyond imagining, and yet my mind fights to get inside that cage. <em>Life-threatening illness. A mother and two daughters. Hannah would want to go to the ballet. Or she would want to ride horses. Or be on a TV show. What would Sophie want? Jesus. Stop.<br />
</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Blessedly, the local news teams call it a wrap. The girl continues on her way to the ballet, to the rest of her life, flanked by her mother and sister.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Gate C2, now boarding Flight 683 to Baltimore, continuing on to Fort Lauderdale.</em> We board, quietly, subdued, as the cameramen break down their equipment. We are all continuing on to another place, to another story—the ones we find, the ones that find us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/07/img_7090.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-397" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/07/img_7090-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I get panicky when the girls are away. They&#8217;re with their dad, visiting the Canadian side of the family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quiet. Too quiet.</p>
<p>Which means, naturally, I start worrying about inanimate objects.</p>
<p>Like, I snapped the shampoo bottle closed WITHOUT LETTING AIR BACK IN. So my poor shampoo bottle was bent over at the middle, squished, suffocating for air. I quick popped the hatch so it could inhale again, then exhaled myself in relief. It was a life-or-death situation, despite the fact that shampoo bottles DO NOT HAVE LUNGS.</p>
<p>This is how I roll.</p>
<p><span id="more-396"></span></p>
<p>When the girls are away, I have to shut the doors to their bedrooms. All of those poor uncomfortable dolls, cast aside, lying in terribly painful positions. THEY TORMENT ME STILL.</p>
<p>When the girls were small and I was a raging stresspot, every night I needed to make certain that every doll—baby, Barbie or Polly Pocket—was reclining or sitting comfortably, with back and neck supported by a hard molded plastic pillow or a pal. I could not sleep, knowing that even one 3-inch Polly Pocket could be suffering from a swiveled &#8220;Exorcist&#8221; head, an overturned princess carriage pinning its torso, or a rigid leg trapped under a doll house. I tell you, dolls in distress and stuffed animals in discomfort are the bane of my existence as a mother. Like the doomed shelter dogs that plague my consciousness, you can&#8217;t save them all. At a certain point, you have to just shut the bedroom door and walk away.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten better over the years. But when the girls are gone and it&#8217;s just me here, my worry ramps up again.</p>
<p>I am afraid to wash their pillows or sheets or dirty clothes, lest bad juju happen and their plane spirals out of control or a Canadian taxi cab runs them over.</p>
<p>Totally normal, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>It started early in life, before labels like &#8220;OCD&#8221; and &#8220;Generalized Anxiety Disorder&#8221; were part of everyday lexicon. When I was little, I just knew that I needed things to go RIGHT, or the world would end. If I didn&#8217;t tell my mother about my school day in absolute full technicolor detail, the day didn&#8217;t count. I am saying THE DAY DIDN&#8217;T HAPPEN. If I touched a light switch the &#8220;wrong&#8221; way, I had to touch it the &#8220;right&#8221; way twice to fix the situation. I was born for Purell, and Purell was created just for me. And: I still have recurring stress dreams to this day that all of the guinea pigs I owned in 1983 are dehydrated and dying because I didn&#8217;t care for them properly (in real life, they had thrived under my fanatical attention to detail, i.e., perfectly selected lettuce leaves and the perfect amount of perfect food and constant fresh water and snuggles).</p>
<p>I am a fun date, no doubt. Everyone wants to be with someone who wakes up sweaty from dying guinea pig nightmares and immediately lunges for the Purell. That&#8217;s HOT.</p>
<p>Is it just me?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/06/img_9419.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-395" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/06/img_9419-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/06/img_9419.jpg"></a>We forget, as often as we can, that childbirth can be as cruel as it is miraculous.</p>
<p>This is the most polite way to say this: A college classmate just lost his beloved wife due to complications during labor. <em>Complications</em> is a kind word for pain, fear and horror leading to loss beyond imagining.</p>
<p>Their newborn daughter—and only child—will never know the mother who&#8217;d been so eagerly awaiting her birth. Family and friends are in shock, trying to come to terms with this loss that should not be, this terrible turn of events. In one day, my classmate becomes a single father and a widower.</p>
<p>There are no words for this, nothing original to be said, nothing that can be said to make any of this right or better or easier.</p>
<p>I knelt and said a prayer for my classmate and his baby daughter. My hand went to my belly, unconsciously, wanting to protect, all over again. I don&#8217;t know the circumstances.</p>
<p>In 2001, my then-husband was at risk of losing me, our first daughter, or both of us to severe preeclampsia. Induced early, our daughter was born at only four pounds. The only details that matter now: she made it; I recovered.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why this could not also have been their story. It should have been their story.<span id="more-394"></span></p>
<p>I study the mother&#8217;s face in a memorial article. I don&#8217;t understand what I am seeing. I blink back tears. This woman is alive, somewhere, surely. There is a newborn, so there must be a mother. There is a daughter, so there must be a mother, <em>a mother must be. </em>This is the only acceptable logic.</p>
<p><em>Passed away unexpectedly.</em> This cannot be right. She is beautiful and bold and strong and grinning in the photo, clearly up for the challenge and joys of new motherhood. They have lost sight of her, that&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s a mistake. She&#8217;s stuck in the hospital elevator, or down in the gift shop, craving a chocolate bar, a coffee, a pink balloon. She&#8217;ll turn up. She must turn up.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know her. I did not know her, though we went to the same college. But I know what she will be missing, and I cannot bear it—not for her, not for daughter, and not for her husband. I want to tear my hair out with the frustration and grief of not understanding how this can be. So I cannot begin to imagine the sorrow of those who loved her dearly, who were looking forward to sharing her new life as a mother.</p>
<p>I want to reach into the photograph and take her by the hand and lead her to a safe place a decade from now, a safe place where she and her husband and their 10-year-old daughter celebrate a birthday that is not also a death day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so sorry, T, J and baby E.</p>

I realize the question is for me. I turn away from the airplane window to the woman on my right, who is studying my face intently. Several hours ago, we&#8217;d exchanged pleasantries and I&#8217;d mentioned that I was a writer.
&#8220;No, not a novelist,&#8221; I say.

<p>I realize the question is for me. I turn away from the airplane window to the woman on my right, who is studying my face intently. Several hours ago, we&#8217;d exchanged pleasantries and I&#8217;d mentioned that I was a writer.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not a novelist,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>She and her husband both look terribly disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you write, then?&#8221; she wants to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever people will pay me to write,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I&#8217;ve written for magazines, papers—&#8221;</p>
<p>The husband perks up considerably. &#8220;Anything we&#8217;ve heard of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, well, let&#8217;s see. I wrote for the <em>Boston Globe</em>, the Sunday Magazine,&#8221; I say. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve done a lot of marketing materials.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nods, but he is not impressed. I am seriously wishing I had ordered the gin and tonic.</p>
<p>&#8220;But no book?&#8221; says the wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;No book. I write plays, though. And poetry. But they don&#8217;t pay the mortgage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I imagine they wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; says the wife.</p>
<p>The husband clears his throat. &#8220;So&#8230;are you part of a pool? A team of writers?&#8221;</p>
<p>I just want to read my book, the book on my lap, the book written by a real writer. I want that gin and tonic very, very, very badly. &#8220;No, no team. I have a parenting blog, and what work I do find often comes through that. But there&#8217;s not a lot of work right now. Freelancers are in a tough spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>They continue staring at me, as if I am an exotic zoo specimen, and they are not quite sure they like what they see.<span id="more-392"></span></p>
<p>I change the subject. &#8220;So is Las Vegas your final destination?&#8221;</p>
<p>They nod. &#8220;It&#8217;s our thirtieth wedding anniversary,&#8221; says the wife. &#8220;He&#8217;s never been to Vegas, so we&#8217;re going.&#8221; She shrugs. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I echo, and return my nose to my book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; she asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;San Diego,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Work?&#8221; she asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Family?&#8221; she presses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of hard to explain. There&#8217;s a fella. I see him every month.&#8221;</p>
<p>The husband frowns. &#8220;That can&#8217;t be easy.&#8221; He seems offended by my circumstances. I resist the urge to swipe his gin and tonic and guzzle it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I say blithely, &#8220;it works for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have children?&#8221; asks the wife. &#8220;How old are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two girls, eight and eleven. They&#8217;re with their dad this week.&#8221; Beads of sweat bust out on my temples. I am cornered. I hate feeling cornered.</p>
<p>They nod, waiting for me to continue. But I have nothing else to say. I have a hard time explaining my life to people I know, let alone to strangers at 38,000 feet.</p>
<p>I turn the tables. &#8220;Thirty years. Wow, that&#8217;s something. That&#8217;s really something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says the wife, primly. &#8220;We&#8217;re staying at the Golden Nugget. Just until Thursday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;happy anniversary,&#8221; I offer. <em>I want my book I want my book I want my book.</em></p>
<p>He leans forward in his aisle seat. &#8220;Do your girls travel with you sometimes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money&#8217;s a little tight, at the moment,&#8221; I say. I get the sense I am being judged, somehow. <em>Single mom. Traveling alone, no kids. No book deal. </em></p>
<p>&#8220;San Diego,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t get much farther away than that.&#8221; He laughs, not a particularly nice sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; I reply, &#8220;it&#8217;s a funny world like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it is,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I guess it is.&#8221; He shakes his head and returns to his gin and tonic, looking smug.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows what the future will bring,&#8221; the wife offers. With that, I am released, dismissed. Relieved, I return to my book. They say nothing to each other, staring straight ahead.</p>
<p>I glance out the window. Colorado? Nevada? The desert landscape below is surreal, crusted and caramelized by sun, split and torn by time.</p>
<p>I feel very small in my narrow seat behind my tiny oval window. What keeps people together for thirty years? Are they happy? Why don&#8217;t I have a book? Is this monthly trip a foolish endeavor? Are my girls okay?</p>
<p>A few hours later, in San Diego, I wait at the baggage claim for my beat-up luggage to arrive. He arrives before the luggage does. He is grinning. I hug him and he hugs me back, for a long moment. I forget to worry that anything should be anything different from exactly this, exactly what is.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I walk into my bedroom. Sitting on my bed is a short, thin, dark-haired woman. She&#8217;s hunched over one of the cats. I have no idea who she is. In the span of several milliseconds, I wonder how she got in, what she wants, and what I should say to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; is what I say, finally. My daughter swivels on the bed, her fingers still buried in our tortoiseshell kitty&#8217;s fur.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8230;you just&#8230;you get taller every day,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>This is not exactly what I am thinking, but I can&#8217;t find the words. Not right then.</p>
<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/06/img_9946.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-391" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/06/img_9946-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>She&#8217;s just come home from four days in Indiana, without either of her parents. AS IN, MY BABY FLEW ON A PLANE WITHOUT HER MOM OR HER DAD TO CRADLE HER TIGHTLY AS TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPENED, LIKE SCARY HIJACKERS AND DRUNK LECHEROUS BUSINESSMEN AND TURBULENCE AND AT LEAST THREE FIERY CRASHES, ALL WITH STOPOVERS IN LAS VEGAS.</p>
<p>She survived none and all of these things, depending on your point of view.</p>
<p><span id="more-390"></span></p>
<p>This year, she and three schoolmates had earned the honor of representing the state of Massachusetts in (deep breath) the Junior Division Global Issues Team Competition of the <a href="http://www.fpspi.org/">Future Problem Solvers Program International Conference.</a> (Yeah, I didn&#8217;t know what that was before, either.) It&#8217;s a long story, but basically, it&#8217;s a whole bunch of awesome kids from around the globe coming together to create detailed action plans for some of the world&#8217;s lousiest problems and then partying down. Two coaches and a parent chaperone were along for the ride, to make sure none of the fifth-grade Massachusetts team got a fake ID or a tattoo.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t get a tattoo, did you?&#8221; I check.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, yeeeeeahhhh,&#8221; she says. She leans over and licks my arm. She is weird. I don&#8217;t know where she gets it.</p>
<p>Four days without her, and she is bigger, broader, brighter, bolder, funnier, louder and more stunning than ever. Or she is not. I am not sure what is going on here. I am feeling very confused. There is a stranger on my bed, petting my cat. Now she is laughing and licking my arm. This is what it is to have a daughter. This is what it is to have a daughter who can board a plane on her own. This is what it is to have a daughter on the verge of becoming a woman, the thing that you have been for a while now, the thing that has gotten old for you, but is exciting and new and uncharted territory for her.</p>
<p>She licks my arm again and reads what I have written, over my shoulder, although she knows I hate when she reads while I am still writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you write &#8217;seems&#8217;, then you have to get rid of &#8216;Or she is not.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; I say. I re-read what I have written and unwritten and rewritten.</p>
<p>&#8220;See?&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Dang. &#8220;You&#8217;re RIIIIIGHT,&#8221; I say, in a sort of teacher-y voice.</p>
<p>She mimics me with gorgeous green crazy-wide eyes. &#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT!&#8217; That was a weird voice, Mom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m just&#8230;you know. I&#8217;m a cockypants when it comes to my writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. You are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, um,&#8221; I continue, &#8220;I&#8217;m kind of impressed that you just edited me. And kind of terrified. My voice doesn&#8217;t know how to handle this moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Terrified?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It means your brain will soon overtake the feeble, weakening brain of your mother. BUT NOT YET.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do the only mature thing I can, in my defeat. I tickle her.</p>
<p>She laughs, the Tickle Laugh. Ah, THERE she is. <em>Yes</em>. That one. In that laugh. Her. She hasn&#8217;t left me, not yet.</p>
<p>She tickles my armpit. &#8220;Ew, it&#8217;s all wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please, like <em>you</em> don&#8217;t sweat,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as much as <em>you</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do too. You get all stinky and sweaty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, thanks,&#8221; she replies, wryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You started it,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s real mature, Mom.&#8221; She licks me a third time. &#8220;See, I FEED you inspiration.&#8221; And: &#8220;I love you, Mom.&#8221;</p>
<p>That laugh again. Yup, she&#8217;s still here. I hope she&#8217;s always here, even when she&#8217;s in her wherever-there.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/06/img_9746.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-389" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/06/img_9746-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I may be a misanthrope, but occasionally, I notice when my iPhone goes missing.</p>
<p>The other day, I realized it had been hours since I&#8217;d thought of it or heard it buzz. I went hunting.</p>
<p>Green tote bag, where had I put it? Ah, yes. Got home, plopped said bag on couch. There it was.</p>
<p>I reached inside and came out with a wad of soaking wet tissues and receipts.</p>
<p>This was bad. This was very, very bad. What the hell?</p>
<p>I dug frantically for my phone and hit plastic: a mostly empty water bottle. Cap, still on. Yet somehow it had leaked.<em> Effity eff eff.</em></p>
<p>I fished and came up with my phone, finally. It looked fine, just a few drops of water beading on its orange plastic case. I pushed the button. Nothing.</p>
<p>I pushed again. Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Maybe I turned it off, I thought. I pressed the top button, the one that generally is not part of my life.</p>
<p>A BIG EXTRA-LOUD NOTHING.<span id="more-388"></span></p>
<p>In total denial, I decided it simply needed to be charged. And so (feel the stoooooopid) I plugged the sucker into its charging cord.</p>
<p>I would like to introduce you to a very, very bad noise:</p>
<p><em>Zzzzcrcrcrzzzkkzzz.</em></p>
<p>Big effity eff eff. I killed it. Oh, I tried the iLazarus trick, plopping it in dry rice for a few days. But my iPhone did not iRise from the iDead. It was toast, and I was unreachable.</p>
<p>I was officially unreachable, a nice sanctioned unreachable, for 72 hours.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t half bad. I kind of miss the days when, if you were out, you were out. If you weren&#8217;t home to answer the phone drilled into the wall, well, no harm, no foul. It was&#8230;peaceful, then.</p>
<p>At the Apple store, they offered me a replacement model for $150. Fair enough. (An upgrade to that vixen call girl Siri would have run me $600.)</p>
<p>And the minute the new one was in my hands, and texts stuck in the pipeline started buzzing through, I felt a pang of something like regret. It was a shock to the system to be without it, but it was a shock to be back on the grid, too.</p>
<p>I tell my girls that I used to write my papers for college in a communal computer lab, and that sometimes, we had to wait for hours to snag a terminal. They stare at me in open-mouthed disbelief when I explain that there was no internet then, not as they know it, at least, and that most families we knew owned a set of encyclopedias. Work stayed at work. Home was home. You were either in the right place at the right time, or you weren&#8217;t. You either saw the movie in the theatre, or you didn&#8217;t see it at all. When you went on vacation, you went on vacation, and no one heard from you for a week. And most people never saw your photos.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful for technology. It&#8217;s allowed me to work and love from a distance, and that&#8217;s a great thing.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s something to be said about being taking a break to be wherever you are, with whomever you&#8217;re with, in real time, in the real world&#8230;without getting pinged.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/05/img_0017.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-387" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/05/img_0017-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>What did you tell yourself you would never do? Only to realize, years later, as an old coot, that you&#8217;d gone ahead and done it? Or become it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pushing 42 here. I&#8217;m hoping this age really <em>is</em> the answer to everything. I&#8217;ve already accumulated plenty of towels, AND I generally wait for other people to tell me when to panic. I must be on the right track.</p>
<p>As my birthday approaches, I find myself waxing a teensy bit nostalgic, a teensy bit regretful, and a whole lotta <em>oh my dear Lord how did that happen? </em></p>
<p>I told myself I wasn&#8217;t a cat person.</p>
<p>I swore I&#8217;d never get divorced.</p>
<p>I predicted I&#8217;d have two boys.<span id="more-386"></span></p>
<p>I said Southern California was the last place on earth I&#8217;d ever want to visit, let alone live in.</p>
<p>I yawned at the entire continent of Asia.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2012, as I type these words with a massive lump of black cat nestled in my lap like a nursing babe. The tortoiseshell, meanwhile, stalks a spider across the room. I sit in the room I once shared with a husband, a man I believed I could not live without, would not ever live without. I&#8217;m breathing just fine, and so is he, somewhere across town. In two hours, I will pick up our two daughters from school and head to Wal-Mart in search of pink posterboard. Later, when the house of girls and cats and dogs is finally quiet, I will catch up with a man in San Diego, a funny, sweet, half-Japanese 3D artist whose grandfather lives in the heart of Tokyo. I&#8217;ll be back in San Diego next month (just like the month before, and the one before that), when we will shop for chairs at Ikea and go surfing and ponder a someday-trip to visit his family in Japan.</p>
<p><em>Busted</em>.</p>
<p>Life has a fab sense of humor.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s <em>your</em> punchline?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/05/dsc05581.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-385" src="http://workitmom.com/bloggers/singlemomatwork/files/2012/05/dsc05581-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The bumblebee had a bun. The ladybug, her identical twin, had a clumsy mess of French braids, studded with plastic barrettes.</p>
<p>I panicked. My neon green T-shirt said &#8220;ASK ME!&#8221; The bumblebee, the ladybug and I were going to hear about this.</p>
<p>One of the dance recital police ladies approached, pointing at the bumblebee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-oh,&#8221; said my daughter, the zebra.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to need to go to the French-braiding station,&#8221; the dance recital police lady ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, I thought French braids or buns were acceptable, no?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dance recital police lady frowned. &#8220;Not for the actual performance. You&#8217;d better get her over to the French-braiding station. Like, now. There&#8217;s already a line.&#8221;</p>
<p>She summoned the ladybug to stand before her. The ladybug held her ground impressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mommy did French braids on me,&#8221; the ladybug told the dance recital police lady. &#8220;But she gave up when it was my sister&#8217;s turn because the French braids were too hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The harried dance recital police officer considered this. I chewed my lip. All around us, little feathered yellow chickens and Sleeping Beauties and Cinderellas and jazzy tappers and Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo girls and parasol carriers and monkeys and kissy dolls and hip-hop Baby Beyonces were wreaking havoc, twirling and spinning and tearing their tights and spilling contraband items like Pepperidge Farms Goldfish.</p>
<p>Dance recital police lady decided to let ladybug&#8217;s subpar French braids go. She had bigger goldfish to fry. She scowled at me. &#8220;Tell her mother no plastic barrettes next time. They catch the light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will do,&#8221; I said.<span id="more-384"></span></p>
<p>Dance recital police lady charged off in the direction of the spilled snack catastrophe.</p>
<p>The bumblebee, the ladybug, and the zebra stared at me, as if I would surely know what came next.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really qualified to wear this T-shirt,&#8221; I told them. &#8220;But, um, I promise I&#8217;ll do my best today.&#8221;</p>
<p>All three nodded. Hannah the zebra beamed. She patted my arm. &#8220;You&#8217;re doing great, Mommy.&#8221;</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>It was not my idea to volunteer as Class Mom for the annual dance recital performance. I wanted to watch my zebra&#8217;s six minutes of fame from the audience, far away from the <em>Sturm und Drang</em> backstage. But when we arrived at the dress rehearsal, we found out that no one from the Intro to Musical Theatre class had a nice unselfish mommy willing to be Class Mom.</p>
<p>The zebra looked hopefully at me, with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I spent sixty dollars on tickets,&#8221; I sputtered. &#8220;So we could sit in the audience and watch you.&#8221;</p>
<p>My zebra hung its head sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? You would rather have me backstage?&#8221;</p>
<p>My zebra nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>I sighed. What&#8217;s sixty bucks between a zebra and her mother?</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>The duties of Class Mom were to wear the neon green &#8220;Ask Me&#8221; shirt, as well as a plastic lei, while assisting the class children into their outfits and into stage makeup and the dreaded regulation French braids, pinned up properly in the back. The duties also included General Order Perpetuation, Minimizing Chaos, Wiping Noses, Blotting Lipstick, Lining Up for Professional Pictures, Keeping Dancers Calm, Keeping Dancers Energized, Keeping Dancers&#8217; Underwear Hidden, and Hiding Pepperidge Farm Products. When Miss Nana clapped for everyone to listen, the Class Moms had to clap back in the same rhythm to Show They Were Listening and that it was Time to Be Still.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look good in green,&#8221; said the zebra, who had brought a lei of her own for me in her dance bag, from her dress-up trunk, just in case they ran out for the actual performance, with a sudden onslaught of Class Mom Tribute Volunteers.</p>
<p>I did my best. I got the bumblebee to the French-braiding station in time. I fastened antennae on both the ladybug and bumblebee. I pinned the zebra&#8217;s hooded mane (on top of the French braids my friend Kate had so carefully wrought, thus obscuring them completely from view). The rest of the Intro to Musical Theatre class had other performances first, so it was a relatively easy matter to look after this peculiar red, black, white and yellow herd.</p>
<p>Clap, clap. Clap clap clap. Miss Nana wanted our attention. Showtime for Musical Theatre. We were on.</p>
<p>I slid into the wings with my three charges, now joined by the rest of their class, waiting to go on.</p>
<p>The wings: this is where I used to wait. This used to be my place. I was an actor. Watching a junior ballerina adjust my zebra&#8217;s ballet shoes, I realized the torch had been passed, and I was more than okay with that.</p>
<p>Lights down. The zebra, the bumblebee, the ladybug and the rest of the Musical Theatre class scurried onstage and took their places. Lights up. I wondered what the show looked like from my purchased seat, then realized I had the best spot in the house.</p>
<p>I know what they didn&#8217;t see. The audience saw no plastic barrettes, no panty lines through tights, no smeared lipstick &#8212; just the unbeatable sweetness of ten little girls putting on a show.</p>
<p>My zebra delivered her one line: &#8220;I&#8217;m not even a HORSE, I&#8217;m a ZEBRA!&#8221; The crowd laughed appreciatively. The kid, well, she was good. The best dancing, singing, marching zebra you&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>After the show, backstage, I hugged her and told her she was fantastic. &#8220;I get to keep the costume,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do you get to keep the Class Mom shirt?&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t. But I didn&#8217;t need to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>She nods and skips back down the stairs.</p>
<p>A moment later, Daughter #2 sticks her head into my room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t hear what we&#8217;re talking about, right?&#8221; she says sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you even tell us if you could?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I say, pondering this. &#8220;I suppose if I thought you might be really disappointed, I might just not tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. I really didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221; She hops downstairs to help her sister. Their dad dropped them off this morning with a bunch of mystery groceries, a nice gesture on his part, so they could make me breakfast for Mother&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>I realize I am not actually worried that they will burn down the house. This is progress, I think. The kids are all right. <span id="more-382"></span></p>
<p>When they finally arrive with breakfast, I am amazed. Scrambled cheesy eggs, turkey bacon, a Greek yogurt and fresh raspberry parfait, cinnamon rolls and orange juice. It is a meal fit for a queen, and I am certainly feeling like one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read your cards,&#8221; they urge me. Daughter #1 offers me hers:</p>
<p><em>Dear Mom, I&#8217;m not going to write in cursive, it would ruin the card. From your firstborn to your second, you&#8217;ve managed to stay sane and have always been there for us. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better mother, in any dimension. Love, S</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I say, &#8220;Just&#8230;oh. I love it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daughter #2 gives me hers, a massive green stapled envelope as long as my arm. Inside, a poem she&#8217;s written.</p>
<p><em>My mom has the best personality.<br />
Of all the moms in the world she&#8217;s the best.<br />
Terrific as always.<br />
Honest and super.<br />
Enjoy being with you!<br />
Rules the house.<br />
She&#8217;s loving!</em></p>
<p><em>Delightful!<br />
Aces every test.<br />
You make me happy!</em></p>
<p>&#8220;OHHH,&#8221; I say again, now completely at a loss for words.</p>
<p>They beam and they hug me.</p>
<p>I squeeze back, marveling at these beauties of mine on this simple quiet morning, four years after the storm of the loss of the family we used to be. But now we are here: It&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day, not Single Mother&#8217;s Day. I am missing nothing, needing nothing, wanting nothing but them. Three is a good number, a very good number, it turns out.</p>

<p>Funny story. Turns out <em>I</em> needed to drive four hours, meet my best friend from childhood at a god-forsaken hotel in the Twilight Zone of Pennsylvania, don purple workout gear, and dive belly-first into mud.</p>
<p>There was more, of course. I also needed to run 3.1 miles through hay bales and rocks and swampy bits and tires and over an 8-foot-high wall and a 35-foot-high cargo net. That was part of it.</p>
<p>Physics lesson: What goes up does not necessarily come down, at least, not right away. It&#8217;s scary at the top, when your legs and arms have turned to jelly.</p>
<p>I did eventually get down. And we crossed the finish line, in respectable time. And that&#8217;s when I realized, <em>Oh, I needed to do that. I didn&#8217;t know it, but that&#8217;s exactly what I needed to do this year.</em><span id="more-380"></span></p>
<p>Do you know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p>I am saying I <em>needed</em> to do these things. Not because they were useful things to do. Not because doing those things would earn me a place on the Olympic Mud Running Team (although I would be a champ), or cold hard cash, or random fame, or a reality TV show. Not because it would really do much of anything particularly sensible. In fact, it cost money to register, it cost money to get there, it cost money to stay there, it cost money to eat there, and it cost money to buy gas to get back home, in worse shape than I was in before I went there to do those odd things. This is kind of silly, viewed in one light.</p>
<p>But here I am, an achey few days later, my bruises blossoming like fat cornflowers, blackberries, blueberries, and I am marveling that a January whim should have turned into a May need, now fulfilled.</p>
<p>My best friend and I, we discussed this over Domino&#8217;s pizza and cheesy bread on her bed at the hotel, post-run. This was the least half-assed thing we&#8217;d done since natural childbirth, we agreed. And this, well, we had a choice that we had to go looking for in the first place: a 5k obstacle course mud run.</p>
<p>I am saying it&#8217;s been a long time since I set a concrete goal—with a partner, no less—and made a plan that actually, well&#8230;worked. A simple plan, that paid off. We signed up, we ran-lurched weekly, in different cities, and <em>hot damn</em>, we ran the race and took on every obstacle. I am saying we got the job done. It&#8217;s no marathon, not even a half-marathon, but it was ours. We owned it and let it own us, for the afternoon. There&#8217;s something to that surrender, giving in to something you&#8217;re not sure at all that you can manage. We didn&#8217;t need to impress anyone. We managed to impress ourselves. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another thing I didn&#8217;t know I needed to do until I listened to my quietest inner voice and went to a writer&#8217;s retreat in Ohio in early February with a bunch of kick-ass women, all strangers to me until we met. That same sensation—twice in a year that&#8217;s not even half over—of yes, yes, exactly, my intuition was spot-on, this is EXACTLY what I needed&#8230;well, it&#8217;s been a good year so far, 2012.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on a roll. But it makes me wonder what your quietest voice might be telling you to do, these days.</p>
<p><strong>So tell me. What do you not know yet that you need to do this year?</strong></p>
