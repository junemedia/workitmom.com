			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the second-grader is in bed, slight cough, feeling warm (though the thermometer indicated no fever), sluggish, stuffed-up, and now, thankfully, pumped full of Benadryl.</p>
<p>My wife is off to NYC tomorrow morning for the next two days (business meetings), so I will be flying solo.</p>
<p>And so what will happen when the kiddo wakes up sicker, can&#8217;t go to school, and I will be lacking a second parent to split the day with me?</p>
<p>Well, maybe one of the grandparents can make it, but we&#8217;re not sure yet.</p>
<p>And maybe I can move one or two of the seven meetings/calls that I have tomorrow (it is Monday, after all).</p>
<p>And maybe our part-time babysitter can come for a few hours.</p>
<p>And maybe I can stay home and do all of my meetings as calls and then stick her in front of &#8220;Spongebob&#8221; multiple times so that I can conduct some of these calls with a minimum amount of productivity.</p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe she will wake up and be ready to go to school.</p>
<p>But then I will send her and then the worst-case scenario will occur: the nurse will call my cellphone just as I am stepping into a meeting at the office to tell me that our daughter is indeed quite sick and in the nurse&#8217;s office and can I please come and pick her up (while her tone indicates that I am a terrible parent who tried&#8211;and did!&#8211;leave his sickly child at the public school because I am negligent and care more about my work than my own offspring).</p>
<p>So, really, it never gets easier.</p>
<p>In fact, it gets harder: before she was in school and we had a full-time nanny, we never had to worry&#8211;she would arrive, sick or not.</p>
<p>And now, we juggle it, on a unicycle, with one hand behind the back sometimes (and we only have one child!).</p>
<p>So take this venting for what it is and let me know: <strong>how do you cope with the inevitable winter sick days?</strong><em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wake up, take forever to make bed and get dressed, eat breakfast, brush teeth, pack bag, put on multiple layers of clothing, wear boots, carry sneakers for PE, get into the car, and just get to school in time for the bell&#8230;</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>What about after school: come home, eat dinner, practice piano, do math homework, write multiple sentences using new vocabulary words for the week such as &#8220;hopeful&#8221; and &#8220;together,&#8221; jump in the shower, brush teeth, fill out the reading log, pajamas, read in bed, and sleep.</p>
<p>So when did we have FUN?</p>
<p>I understand the weekend, yeah, but c&#8217;mon, man, where&#8217;s the fun in being a kid these days?</p>
<p>Lately we have been taken to scaring each other when the other is in the bathroom. Superfun.</p>
<p>We take time to play games, run around, ride the bike, go for a hike, coordinate playdates, bake cookies, chat about the goings-on of second grade.</p>
<p>It was my morning for school drop-off today, and as we kissed goodbye, I said &#8220;have fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Have &#8220;fun&#8221; at school?<br />
Is that okay?<br />
Maybe? Yes?</p>
<p>So I hope she does have fun.<br />
Can you have &#8220;fun&#8221; while you learn?<br />
Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s make sure the kids are still having fun, away from all the activities and the structure and the resume-builders. Cut loose.</p>
<p>To be cliched, they&#8217;re only young once, and what better way to take advantage of that youth than just have fun. </p>
<p>For you and for them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I walked into my colleague&#8217;s office today and he showed me a video on his phone of his three-year-old son riding a two-wheeler all over their suburban street in remarkable glee, helmet strapped on tight, and WITHOUT TRAINING WHEELS.</p>
<p>Did I mention that he&#8217;s three?</p>
<p>Turns out, my colleague attributes this early bike-riding success to the fact that for his second birthday they bought him some sort of German bike, made from wood (of course) that has no pedals. Using said bicycle, the child apparently learns to balance him/herself and by the time the child grows to the size and age of a real bike, it is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Seems the Germans were right on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the parents of my daughter were not so smart: I had learned to ride a bike without the assistance of German engineering and I assumed that my daughter would be no different. We are now on our second bike (she outgrew the first) and we are working on 3+ years here, still afraid to fall, unable to steer, determined as ever (both she and I).</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s the day,&#8221; I said to her when I picked her up from a sleepover at grandparents&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The day for what?&#8221; she wanted to know, of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;To ride your bike!&#8221; (too much pressure? probably.)</p>
<p>And yet, she achieved numerous spurts where I did not hold the back of her seat, triumphant moments, and moments which quickly ended with a sharp veer off of the path by the river, mama cheering us on all the way, as I sweat through my t-shirt the way a farm animal might (if farm animals wore clothing). </p>
<p>Sigh. One more loop.</p>
<p>The exercise over, 40 solid minutes and one snack later, we walked and pedaled back to the car, with me right behind the daredevil. She had one last spurt in her.</p>
<p>And of course, as these things go, her last spurt went right, and I watched in slo-mo, as the front wheel hit the curb of a building stoop at a blistering 1.85 mph, and down she went, her slender body slowly toppling down onto the pavement, the tears of pain and tiredness begin to stream down her beautiful face.</p>
<p>I pick her up and she takes mama&#8217;s hand. The sniffles slow. After 2 blocks, she is talking again, almost as if nothing has happened.</p>
<p>And I play it back in my head, realizing that I might have been able to catch her from falling all the way, but I did not&#8211;did I let her fall? I think I did. I think I wanted her to fall so she could know not to be afraid of falling off her bike, that this was nothing, that a barely bruised hip and a scraped knee are nothing compared to the big tumbles that certainly await her as she grows older&#8230;</p>
<p>Did I really let her fall to teach her a lesson? To be that dad that is terrified that his only daughter will grow up too &#8220;soft&#8221; and afraid to fall? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure exactly why, but I do know that she learned how to fall.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I won&#8217;t even try to come up with an excuse for my absence with the keyboard, but I hope you didn&#8217;t click over here expecting me to actually provide you with real live answers to the &#8220;tough&#8221; questions of life &#8217;cause that ain&#8217;t happenin&#8217;.</p>
<p>(Apologies for the false advertising in the title.)</p>
<p>What I will do is tell you how I have tried to answer some of the very curious inquiries that have come our way in recent weeks from the ever-expanding mind of our almost-seven-year-old.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the most recent, coming from the pages of the Passover Haggadah:</p>
<p>#1: &#8220;I read in the book that God is on heaven and earth, but how can God be everywhere at the same time?!?&#8221;</p>
<p>My answer: &#8220;Some people think that God is not like a person, but more like the air, all around us, almost like the force (from &#8220;Star Wars&#8221;), so it can be in heaven, in the sky, and on earth.&#8221; (Response evoked excitement because it made her think of &#8220;Star Wars,&#8221; a new favorite movie obsession.)</p>
<p>#2: &#8220;What does it mean, the <em>slaying of the first born</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>My answer: This one was tough, cmon. &#8220;It means that the first-born children of the Egyptians actually died and the Pharoah got very scared. But you know that it is just a story.&#8221;<br />
(follow-up today: &#8220;I bet the first-born children just got really sick&#8221;)</p>
<p>See, these are tough questions.<br />
And there&#8217;s no school for this.<br />
Or an online course.</p>
<p>And then the mother of all questions&#8230;</p>
<p>#3: &#8220;What do you think happens when you die?&#8221;</p>
<p>My answer: Ummmm&#8230;..</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts? Tough questions you&#8217;ve gotten? Share!</strong><em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(First off, please excuse the long absence. I have no good excuse.)</p>
<p>Stay right there, I need to vacuum the playroom, be right back.</p>
<p>Okay, all done. Time to tell you that the Brits have cracked the code and workitmom.com has caught on! <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/04/fathers-happier-more-housework-study">Check it out - here!</a></p>
<p>So how does it break down in our suburban household?</p>
<p>Now I certainly don&#8217;t do as much as my dear wifey - she cooks it all and ORGANIZES it all - I try to pull my own weight in our &#8220;modern&#8221; family (laundry, trash, dishes&#8230;) and gosh darnit, I am HAPPY. </p>
<p>Well, almost.<br />
As the &#8220;modern&#8221; father quoted says, and I concur:<br />
<em>&#8220;Entirely by accident, I seem to have stumbled on the recipe for happiness. Though I&#8217;m not sure if happy is the first word my wife or children – or anyone else for that matter – would use to describe me. Happy is far too stable a word. It speaks of consistency and optimism, both of which I only ever experience fleetingly. Grumpy. That sounds a bit closer. Neurotic, high maintenance, insomniac. Now we&#8217;re getting somewhere.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>So &#8220;happy&#8221; is a relative term.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Are you a happy pappy or do you have a happy hubby because he can rock that Dyson?</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When anyone asks me how old my daughter is, I usually say (with wry, sardonic wit, and a pinch of sarcasm): </p>
<p>&#8220;Six&#8230;teen.&#8221;</p>
<p>They look at me, confused, so I clarify.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is six, but she is going on sixteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Our rambunctious, monkey-like, silly, Ramona-Quimby-reading first-grader is just around the corner from being that sixteen year-old teenage daughter that will cause me to have double-bypass surgery in my early years. I just know it.</p>
<p>And still, I say all of this half-jokingly. </p>
<p>At least I DID, until last week, when innocence was lost. Tossed out the window, off the cliff, and is almost nearly and basically gone forever.</p>
<p>What happened was this:</p>
<p>At my rents&#8217; home for dinner, we asked child to demonstrate some of the steps she learned in her amateur dance class.</p>
<p>She kicks off the routine, doing the cha-cha, and then, as she gets into the swing of it, she looks at me, and with the most natural of movements, with not a care in the world, she&#8230;</p>
<p>WINKED</p>
<p>at me. Smiled, and kept going.</p>
<p>I stood there in shock. Frozen. Unclear on what had just happened.</p>
<p>But it had.</p>
<p>My little baby had just winked, a come-hither, an I&#8217;m-too-cool-for-this-shirt wink.</p>
<p>And my world collapsed. I shook my head in disbelief.</p>
<p>And I kiss her every chance I get.</p>
<p>Because the moments are dwindling.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to stir up the pot here too much, but I have now heard one too many people tell me that I/we &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; have just one kid.</p>
<p>Really? Are you gonna give me another one to go with the one I already have?</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t?</p>
<p>I think not. I think we will be just fine with just one (even if many others might disagree).</p>
<p>Now I know this ain&#8217;t a new topic, but it caught the top of my mind as we spent the weekend with a small wedding party of friends and family - many siblings on display, and a few only children.</p>
<p>The tendency is always to ask which is &#8220;better&#8221; or who is &#8220;happier&#8221;?</p>
<p>I have been able to stop doing asking those questions, recognize (and celebrate) the differences. Though I never did think I would have an only child (mostly because I am not one - I have a younger brother), I am convinced you really just have to do what is right for you.</p>
<p>I have now witnessed siblings who are completely at odds and detract from one another, and others where it works.</p>
<p>I have been friends with many only children, some who have embraced, some who now have two children of their own (perhaps because they regretted their only-childhood).</p>
<p>But there is no answer, methinks&#8230;</p>
<p>What do YOU say?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently hired a new guy on the team.</p>
<p>Everyone liked him in the interviews: he was affable, well-spoken, honest about what he&#8217;d done and what he didn&#8217;t know, and we closed the deal and brought him on.</p>
<p>I was quite confident he would grow into the role we needed, and two months in, he is well on his way to doing so.</p>
<p>But initially, and still, I was skeptical for only one reason: when he interviewed, his wife was due at any day with their second child. And I knew that given our intense work environment - especially in the first few months (as I knew firsthand) - it would be a challenge: both for him to stay awake and pull the hours and for me to train him.</p>
<p>(Yup, look at me: I live in a glass house and I am throwing stones.)</p>
<p>But I hired him because I was confident that he and I would work something out - man to man, father to father, professional to professional.</p>
<p>And we have, so far, with some challenges.</p>
<p>You see, he is - like me - a working father who also tries to be present at home, and therein lies the challenge.</p>
<p>As I have written before, I work with a number of fathers, but almost of all of them have wives who don&#8217;t work, which means they are mostly free to just, well, work - and if they can get home to be with the kids, that is great. My new guy&#8217;s wife is not currently working, but she is planning to and always has. </p>
<p>So, how did it go, you ask?</p>
<p>Honestly, I started out with a big bucket of empathy and understanding and told him that he would be able to work from home soon and leave early and la dee da&#8230;</p>
<p>But as the work piled up and he seemed to be always tired, I will admit, I grew frustrated. There was a TON of work to do, and if he couldn&#8217;t get it done, it was left to me to cover for him. No good.</p>
<p>So we talked about expectations - what I needed from him, what he wanted to do, and what his wife was demanding of him (and this was the most pressing need).</p>
<p>And gradually we seemed to reach a place where everyone was getting what they needed, perhaps.</p>
<p>He is now putting in more hours, he is taking more ownership, and he says that his wife is more understanding&#8230;but the whole situation has left me in an odd and new place - confronted, as a manager, with the same decisions that my own managers have had, and it has shown me just how tricky it can be to manage a working parent (and specifically, one who is doggedly sleep deprived - I think we all know that feeling all too well).</p>
<p>Coffee, anyone?<br />
<strong><br />

How stressed are you, right now, on a scale of 1 to 10?
Myself, the father half of a two-parent working family, I would say I am about a 7.8/10.
Why?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick, take a stress test:</p>
<p>How stressed are you, right now, on a scale of 1 to 10?</p>
<p>Myself, the father half of a two-parent working family, I would say I am about a 7.8/10.</p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Let me count the ways&#8230;</p>
<p>1. The other half is on the road for the week, so I am flying solo<br />
2. Was stuck in an important meeting and was late to get home for the babysitter<br />
3. During the meeting while I was already going to be late, I get a call on my cell - it&#8217;s the babysitter saying don&#8217;t be late<br />
4. She says don&#8217;t be late because she doesn&#8217;t feel well and, turns out, she was at the ER last night<br />
5. I have to leave said meeting early to race home and ensure that all is okay<br />
6. All is okay at home except for the un-well babysitter, so I must speak to parents about possibly taking over for said babysitter for the rest of the week while I attend meetings and get asked why I have to leave early<br />
7. Did I mention that it is so hot outside it feels like someone is blowing a hair dryer on my face (on high) at all times?<br />
8. And that I sweat instantly.<br />
9. Oh yeah, don&#8217;t forget to practice piano, water the plants and flowers, talk to mother-in-law, get child to bed, arrange for weekend plans, and then&#8230;<br />
10. Deal with some sort of mysterious toilet leak, which causes<br />
11. The bathroom mat (and my shorts) to get all wet, so must launder both, while I walk around in my underwear (which I actually enjoyed, I admit it)<br />
12. And then it&#8217;s back to work until midnight<br />
13. Because, obviously, I had to leave early</p>
<p>so yeah, 7.8/10 is a tad generous, I think.</p>
<p>Now, are us working fathers who want to be &#8220;involved&#8221; fathers just as &#8220;stressed&#8221; as our motherly counterparts?</p>
<p>I say YES! Here&#8217;s what the NY Times has to say: <br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/weekinreview/20parkerpope.html?_r=1">right here</a></b>.</p>
<p>Convince me why you are right.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite movies of all time is Clint Eastwood&#8217;s masterful western &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105695/">The Outlaw Josie Wales</a>&#8221; (1976) - it is the true culmination of Eastwood&#8217;s work in westerns and is rivaled only by his 1992 Oscar-winner, &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105695/">Unforgiven</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Josie Wales, Eastwood rides into town, alone, to confront the masses.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how I kinda felt last Friday as I unsaddled my SUV and rode into my daughter&#8217;s elementary school, sun blazing above, surrounded by (pretty much) ALL mothers.</p>
<p>Now I obviously have nothing against mothers, but it struck me - this time - that I was seriously in the minority here, and it just felt weird. </p>
<p>I continue to hit this point again and again, but when you feel it all/most of the time, one would argue that it makes some sense to explore.</p>
<p>On one level, it&#8217;s all so obvious: the huzzies are off working and the moms do school pick-up at 3pm on Friday (sometimes with the dog and the younger siblings).</p>
<p>But if that&#8217;s true, then I keep coming back to the question of where all of these working women/mothers are - or are they just not in our neighborhood?</p>
<p>And mind you, I get the same thing at the doctor, the dentist, and often when I do school drop-off. I am really, truly not trying to toot my own horn here - rather, I am trying to find out:</p>
<p>Where have all the fathers gone?</p>
<p>Because I only see a few of them, and I am waiting for the revolution to begin.</p>
<p>Are we ready for it, or will it never come?</p>
